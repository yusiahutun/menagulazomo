But a vet has warned that one popular feature could seriously hurt your pet and burn your dog's paws when overheated.
Some may be surprised to hear that fake grass - which absorbs and retains heat very well - is a common culprit for this.
Dr Sarah-Jane Molier, based in the Greater Oxford Area, told Pets Radar that burns - especially if they're severe - are not only painful for your pet, but can take a long time to heal and put your pooch at risk of infection."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

such as swelling, pain or coloured discharge - and may need extra care or even antibiotics.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A bandage may also be helpful as, if your dog needs it, balms and medicated creams could very quickly be licked off.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A vet will advise on the most appropriate treatments.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>More minor cases are likely to heal within seven days but more intense cases could see the process taking several weeks.</p>&lt;!- -
