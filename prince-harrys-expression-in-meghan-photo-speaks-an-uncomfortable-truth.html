However, at their latest outing, <a href=#>TikTok</a> users were doing the paps job for them.</p><p>Royal expert Daniele Elser <a href=# rel=nofollow>says</a>: “For Harry and Meghan, it’s not just the trailing, buzzing paparazzi they have to worry about breaching their privacy or recording them but every single one of the 310 million people with smartphones too.”</p><p>She then compares the contrast to the treatment <a href=#>Prince William</a> and Kate Middleton get in the UK. Back in June, she states, William took a night out in London with his fellow school friends. However, only a few identical photos were sent to the press, in contrast to ‘hundreds’ of Harry and Meghan videos.</p><p><a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> also took an outing to a 24-hour music festival at Houghton Hall in August, and once again, only one photo was shared to X, formerly known as <a href=#>Twitter</a> despite a crowd of almost 10,000.</p><p>“What the deluge of Sussexes-at-Beyonce TikToks and social media videos demonstrate is the fundamental difference in the public’s thinking and attitudes in the US versus the UK. What boundaries, what hesitations, what natural inclinations to let them be which might exist across the Pond are unlikely to be found Stateside,” Elser explains.</p><p>She goes on to say that the Sussexes are viewed as <a href=#>celebrities</a> in the USA, whereas in Britain, she claims there is “a much higher degree of respect for members of the royal family”. She says that as they are viewed of this status, “members of the public have seemingly no concerns or hesitations about whipping out their phones to record the Sussexes in the wild, so to speak.”</p><p>Harry and Meghan lived together as a couple from 2017-2020, although the royal expert is “unable to recall” a photo or video shot by a member of the public shared on social media. Likewise, has only ever seen a “handful of iPhone photos or videos” surface of the Prince and Princess of Wales or their kids.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-pictured-looking-giddy-at-lionel-messi-game>Harry pictured looking ‘giddy’ at Lionel Messi game</h2><p>Shortly after the Beyonce concert, the 38-year-old was once again pictured by paps and fans as he attended the Inter Miami v Los Angeles FC game <a href=#>without Meghan Markle</a>.</p><p>Supporting the royal expert’s claims, as well as Harry, celebrities such as <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a>, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Tyga were also pictured at the event.</p><p>However, royals attending sporting events are not uncommon. Prince William and his son, Prince George were pictured at the Euro finals in 2021.</p><p>Earlier this year, William and <a href=#>Princess Charlotte wished the England Lionesses</a> the ‘best of luck’ in their World Cup final via a social media video as he unfortunately, could not be in attendance.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2aAcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2KxknrCgp7K0v8iopWahnmK6prPHmqVmqJikwbB50qmcmqOjYq6vedSnmqillqS%2Fta3BpZxmrKKqwal7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
