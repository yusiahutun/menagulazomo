“Geely’s successful test flight shows that it has enough scientific and technical capability to realise [the commercial viability of] its flying car project,” said Wang Ke, a senior consultant focused on the car industry, at Beijing-based consultancy Analysys."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That helps accelerate AeroHT’s efforts to produce its sixth-generation eVTOL vehicles for the domestic market, according to Xpeng.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/02/01/b25a88be-fcc5-439d-8765-6abc3ab17464_cb4f5de2.jpg>Geely, which acquired Volvo Cars in 2010, a controlling stake in Lotus Cars in 2017 and a minority interest in Mercedes-Benz Group in 2018, showed its ambition to take to the skies when it agreed to buy <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">US flying car start-up Terrafugia</span></a> in June 2017. Founded in Boston by a group of Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduates in 2006, the firm designed the world’s first practical flying car, called the Transition.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Terrafugia’s flying car costs US$279,000 and can travel a distance of 800 kilometres. Li, who once said that a car is merely “two sofas on top of four wheels in an iron shell”, said at the time that Geely’s vision is to make flying cars a reality.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">German air taxi firm Volocopter eyes China expansion with Geely venture</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The AE200 X01 prototype is the largest eVTOL vehicle to complete a maiden flight in China and has met all technical conditions for flying, according to Aerofugia. “It marks a milestone in the development of the aircraft and lays the foundation for carrying out a subsequent series of test flights,” a company representative said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Aerofugia, which formed a joint venture with Volocopter in 2021, will continue test flights of the prototype to accumulate safety data before it applies for a formal licence to commercially release the eVTOL vehicle. The Aerofugia representative said that type of certification is likely to be obtained “within three to five years”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At present, the AE200’s government permit stipulates that its purpose is for sightseeing, emergency healthcare and logistics – making it an alternative to a car for a person’s daily commute.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The global “urban air traffic” sector is projected to become a US$1.5 trillion industry by 2040, with China accounting for about 29 per cent of the total market, according to a Morgan Stanley report published in 2021.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2022/10/12/clean.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:37</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Chinese two-seater ‘flying car’ makes first public flight in Dubai</p><p>Chinese two-seater ‘flying car’ makes first public flight in Dubai</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Chinese government has been gradually relaxing its restrictions on low-altitude airspace – the airspace below 1,000 metres – for civilian use to promote the rapid development of its civil aviation industry. In March last year, the Ministry of Transport released a development plan that listed flying cars among the major tasks from 2021 to 2035.</p>The current eVTOL vehicles being tested are poised to address ground traffic congestion in urban areas and reduce carbon emissions.
