On Friday, ahead of the release of her new album &#34;Humble Quest,&#34; the country music superstar took to Instagram to reminisce about her controversial decision to be proud of her body and own her sexuality by choosing to appear in the magazine."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Don’t sleep on us. We tell your down home stories in the most unflinching, gorgeous lane."</p><p>Well, it didn't take long for modern country music fans to echo the haters of the late 2010s, slapping their judgment all over the beautiful and powerful image she shared from the shoot.</p><p>But Morris wasn't there for it in 2019 and she's certainly not there for it in 2022. When one commenter wrote, "Please dress appropriate," as captured by <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>," Morris didn't hesitate to not only reply.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:40ac6e74-b142-4942-978a-fb0cbde42e33 data-container-ref=toofab:article:673baa64-5abb-405b-90c0-93a08c301de8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/61/5by4/2022/02/14/6173267d3b654ee8b76704ed25130e89_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Secrets of Playboy: Models Felt They Had to Sleep with Hef to Land Playmate of the Year</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>She also shared the comment and her epic reply to her IG Stories to emphasize what women have to deal with -- and even more in country music, where some fans have this narrowly conservative view of what should and shouldn't be acceptable.</p><p>"RESPECT 4 MOM BOOBZ," Morris hilariously comment back to the original poster. In her Stories, she noted, "I see this kind of comment a lot on country music accounts at me, soooooo GET OVER IT."</p><p>Another commenter wrote, "Its sad that people feel like they need to show off their body to be liked," with a commenter agreeing, "yes! It’s not empowering to get naked in front of a camera, it’s sad."</p><p>Morris didn't jump into this discussion, nor most of the others that cropped up, but plenty of her fans had her back anyway, with one telling these commenters, "It is sad that you think you have the right to judge another women’s choices."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:7b2f7b44-d818-4a12-81f3-1c695578a519 data-container-ref=toofab:article:673baa64-5abb-405b-90c0-93a08c301de8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a6/5by4/2022/03/18/a66eac0facea465bba36523c01993b71_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Teddi Mellencamp Reveals Skin Cancer Scare, Reminds Fans to 'Get Your Yearly Skin Check'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Morris did get a lot of love and support in the post, as well, including from many of her famous friends. "Wow Wow," commented Amanda Kloots with three fire emojis, while Kyle Richards matched her emoji for emoji with the additional comment, "Holy smoke show."</p><p>Leann Rimes defended Morris' photoshoot, and decisions about her own body, commenting, "I adore this photo! You look stunning! The ones talking shit are only DYING to let this side of themselves out. Expression, not repression."</p><p>Love in the form of heart emojis came in from Mickey Guyton and Jenna Dewan, while Carson Kressley came in with the applause, applause, applause for Morris' message.</p><p>Now that she's got this message off her chest, Morris is ready for her "next album era" when "Humble Quest" drops on March 25, 2022.</p><a id=gallery-link-ade85267-603f-4e41-baf6-b294f7a64f60 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:ade85267-603f-4e41-baf6-b294f7a64f60 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:673baa64-5abb-405b-90c0-93a08c301de8 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/52/4by3/2022/03/12/525b1cde8a2748b1826535d45ff4e8bd_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j2xma2hfoq6zsc1mpKiqop7AbrDEn5ynnKNiwbC8y56qrGWgoa66rs6yZKygn6TBbsDHmqtmn5%2BpeqJ5y6irZqeWYrWiwMRmnp6so2LAqa3MnptmmZyherDCxKtkmp%2BRnrtw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
