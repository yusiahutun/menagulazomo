Whenever they had time off from school, they would pack their bags and attend their father’s “Margaritaville”-themed concerts.</p><p>Jimmy believed his kids wanted to see him perform so much because they enjoyed the full experience of attending one of his shows. “All my kids came on the road with me because they liked to see the circus,” he joked.</p><p>If you’ve ever been to one of his concerts, you know you’re probably going to see people dressed up in grass skirts and coconut bras. However, that was only one reason why Jimmy brought his kids along with him. He also wanted them to “have a better sense of the world” than he did when he was a boy.</p><p>“[I’m] not a good disciplinarian,” he said about his parenting style. But luckily for Jimmy, he can always count on his wife to lay down the law when the kids misbehave. “Jane runs the show,” he admitted, and he liked it like that.</p><p>After so many years touring, Jimmy was still the same guy who liked to put on a good show for people. “I think I’m still living the Jimmy Buffett life,” he once told <a href=#>NPR</a>. “I make time. The work-to-play ratio is I think what’s important. And it’s not a demand for products. It’s a demand for a feeling that we need — you need to get away.”</p><p>In 2021, Jimmy revealed that he instilled in his children the importance of giving back when one’s had his level of good fortune. “I was always raised to be not a hater. And I was always raised with noblesse oblige — to give back if you’re lucky enough — thanks to my parents,” he told <a href=#>Billboard</a>. “I just try to stick to those two things. I was taught not to hate in the segregated South. And I was taught to give back, and I’m trying to teach my children the same thing.”</p><p>Sadly the “It’s 5 O’Clock Somewhere” singer died at the age of 76 on September 1, 2023.&nbsp;“Jimmy passed away peacefully on the night of September 1st surrounded by his family, friends, music and dogs,” a statement on his Instagram announced. “He lived his life like a song till the very last breath and will be missed beyond measure by so many.”</p><p><strong>Scroll below to learn more about Jimmy’s three kids!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46joKalqWKvtrLFnqutq12gtqW%2FjKacnqxdqbWmecyaqaCZop7BosLIpaOeZaOeu6ix0axkbGWTnbatsNGepWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
