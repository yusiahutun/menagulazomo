Similar is the case of actor Allen Payne, who tries best to conceal about his personal matters and that has led the way for many rumors to arise.</p><p>An American actor, Allen Payne has a stagnant personal life. He has not yet made the headlines with the truthful information about his affair or beau. Whatever is heard about his love life is one way or the other is a rumor. But who knows, the story may be otherwise than what we hear.</p><h2>Girlfriend Rumors; Is He Married? Wife and Kids?</h2><p>Though there is no any authentic information regarding Allen’s relation, he is often said to be <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">linked</a> with actress Demetria McKinney. Allen and Demetria worked together in the movie “House of Payne.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-198 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=198 style="margin-left:auto!important;width:580px;margin-right:auto!important;text-align:center!important;min-width:580px;max-width:580px;line-height:0;padding:0;float:none!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important;margin-top:15px!important;display:block!important;min-height:400px"></span></p><p><strong>Caption: The rumored couple, Allen Payne and Demetria McKinney sharing the love in the movie, House of Payne, published on Nov 4, 2009.</strong></p><p>Well, it is evident that the couple looked perfect together in the video, but it is all about their movie. We still don’t know about the lady with whom Allen is sharing these beautiful moments. We hope that Allen will soon let his fans know about his girlfriend.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=199 style="margin-bottom:15px!important;max-width:580px;line-height:0;float:none!important;display:block!important;text-align:center!important;min-width:336px;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;margin-right:auto!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important;width:580px;margin-top:15px!important;margin-left:auto!important;min-height:400px;padding:0;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important"></span>As we told earlier, Allen is a secret keeper who tries best to confine his personal life. So who knows, Allen may have a different world than what we see him in the media. But for now, we cannot say anything about his married life and family.No information about who his wife is or&nbsp;his kids has come forth. If you know, don’t forget to write in the comment box below.</p><h2>Is he Gay?</h2><p>Allen Payne is handsome and single but is rumored with few other female celebs. However, his relationship is not confirmed. So, it is obvious for some people to suspect that he may be a gay. Nevertheless, we cannot say anything unless Allen himself tells about his sexual orientation.</p><h2>Allen Payne Talks About Career and current state of life:</h2><p>The 48-year-old actor has gone through quite a lot in his career as an actor, and he shared his outlook on life in an interview Blackdoctor.org where he had some heavy truth to drop.</p><p>Allen talked about his experience as a Black actor who has worked in the Entertainment industry for 20 years and talked about what it truly takes to prosper in the industry saying, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=600 style="margin-bottom:15px!important;max-width:580px;padding:0;min-height:400px;line-height:0;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;margin-top:15px!important;margin-left:auto!important;text-align:center!important;width:580px;margin-right:auto!important;display:block!important;min-width:580px;float:none!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important"></span></p><p>“It’s so rare for someone to have a career and expand over 20 years. I don’t know too many Black actors in particular. It’s actually very few. In order to do it you not only have to be very talented. You gotta be really lucky and you have to be diligent and just really blessed and feel like every opportunity to work is a new opportunity. You’re not owed anything in this life and as long as you are connected to The Creator, all things are possible. You have to stay there. If you don’t stay there then it’s almost impossible.”</p><p>The actor also revealed that the most important thing when working was to never lose one's self and to be themselves stating,</p><p>After my mother died, I stepped away from acting.&nbsp;I chose to&nbsp;look inward and find myself, and I think that’s important when you’re an actor. You spend so much time trying to work and being interpreted by fans, executives and people in Hollywood, that you can lose a sense of yourself. You’ve got to get back to that.”</p><p>Payne also revealed that he has no major plans regarding his work currently, and that &nbsp;the only thing he plans to do is to do his part and "just try to leave a legacy of a brother who worked hard, who understood who he was and spend a lot of time trying to help others reach that same point in their lives."&nbsp;</p><p>These are quite Bold words coming from a wise man indeed.</p><h2>Allen Payne's Short Bio:</h2><p>Born on July 7, 1968,&nbsp;Allen Payne is a television and movie actor famous for his performance in the television series Tyler Perry's House of Payne (2006-2012) and movie New Jack City, 1991.
