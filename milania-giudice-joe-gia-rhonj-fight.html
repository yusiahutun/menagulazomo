"Yeah you are, there's no reason for you not to," Gia tells her -- but her sister is still holding onto their uncle's confrontations with both Teresa and Gia.</p><p>"Obviously I'm hurt over what happened. Seeing him scream at you when he was saying things about Dad, I cannot watch that," she says, referring to Joe's past battles with Teresa. Then, looking at Gia, she adds, "Then you told me everything that happened. I would have flipped out."</p><p>"Gia and my brother made up," says Teresa, while Gia adds that she and Joe "said our piece" during the previous party and "everyone was meaning to resolve things." She then asks why Milania wants to keep holding onto this grudge.</p><p>"He hasn't even talked to me," replies Milania, before Gia gets a confessional of her own to talk about her sister's big heart. "But if you go after her dad, the guy she loves the most, she is gonna have a biggest grudge against you," adds Gia.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:de2f21b2-3edf-4041-9494-5fbddcf6b01a data-container-ref=toofab:article:2abb6d7b-7f3b-40c4-95f1-c1874e719f6a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/68/5by4/2022/02/08/6894b5f8951c43ea811c78a38e6cd531_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Gia Giudice and Uncle Joe Gorga Get Into Nasty RHONJ Fight Over Joe Giudice</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Teresa tells her daughter that all they want is peace, reminding Milania that Joe is not only her uncle, but also her "only family."
