(Srinivasan was staying with Duraipandian until he got settled in Washington.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Duraipanidan “suspects that [Srinivasin] might have gone on the water slide not knowing the water depth was the same as the rock jump,” according to the report. That area, known as the “Activity Pool,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>is designated</a> for “strong swimmers only.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Police described a chaotic scene that day, with more than 8,500 guests at the water park in temperatures reaching the upper 80s. As the scene unfolded, a large crowd of more than 300 people began amassing around the pool with some becoming unruly, yelling and swearing, the report says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Some witnesses are saying that lifeguards <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>responded too slowly</a> in coming to the man’s aid.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Police reports state that around 5 p.m., a 17-year-old lifeguard saw what was variously described as “a blob” or “a body” in the water and jumped in but didn’t find anything “due to the murkiness of the water.” Her supervisor also looked but didn’t see anything, according to reports.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another lifeguard, 21, told police that some kids told him they saw a body at the bottom of the pool but he “believed that they were pranking him and….told the children it was paint scrapes on the bottom,” the police report states.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At about 5:15 to 5:20 p.m., someone dropped their glasses into the water and when an 18-year-old lifeguard went in to get them, he spotted the man at the bottom of the pool, police said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another lifeguard, 17, jumped into the water and they both brought the man up and starting performing CPR, according to reports.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">South King Fire and Rescue arrived at 5:32 p.m. and took over CPR, but “he never was resuscitated,” South King Fire Capt. Jeff Bellinghausen tells PEOPLE. “He was deceased on the scene,” police spokeswoman Cathy Schrock tells PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Our entire team is greatly saddened by this loss and we are working to fully understand the circumstances around this tragic accident,” Wild Waves said in a statement released by police. “We take safety extremely seriously and have made our entire team available to investigators….We are actively reviewing the facts as they become available including all of our safety protocols, reports from officials and the actions taken by our staff.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wild Waves did not immediately return PEOPLE’s request for further comment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Infosys spokeswoman Pilar Elvira Wolfsteller tells PEOPLE the company is, “saddened by the loss of our colleague and extend our deepest condolences to his family,” she said. “We are in touch with them, and will ensure all possible support to them at this difficult time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Oauaau0aKrsmedlrtusMieqmaZpGLEqrjDZq6arpWoerit056pZqiRp7hutc1mrpqrmJ67qMDOp2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
