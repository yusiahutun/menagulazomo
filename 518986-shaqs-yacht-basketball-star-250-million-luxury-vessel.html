What is the name of the luxury vessel? What is Shaq's Yacht? These are some of the questions being asked by the fans of the retired basketball player. Here is what you need to know.</p><h2>Does Shaq have a yacht?</h2><p class=align-left><a href=#>Shaquille O’Neal </a>is arguably one of the greatest names in basketball history. He is a former professional basketball player and sports analyst on the television program <i>Inside the NBA</i>. Because of his luxurious profession, Shaq has become famous and wealthy.</p><p class=align-left>Big Shaq is living large because of his massive net worth. Therefore, it should not come as a surprise that he owns a yacht. He has achieved more than he ever imagined. For him, buying a fancy yacht is as much of an investment as buying a car is for ordinary people.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/331564d4a940257a.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dubai Billionaire Flaunts Mega Mansion with Bugatti in Living Room, Bespoke Rolls Royce Vehicles</span></p></a><h2>What is the name of Shaq's yacht?</h2><p class=align-left>The stories regarding Shaq's yacht have caused excitement all over the internet. As a result, several names have come up. Unfortunately, the former <a href=#>basketball player</a> has never shared the vessel's name openly.</p><p class=align-left>Some <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reports allude</a> that Shaq named his yacht Free Throw, and others even added a little to call it the Free Thrower. Others have claimed that Shaq named his yacht Shaqapulco. Apparently, Shaqapulco was the name of his seaside Florida mansion that he put up for sale in 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/331564d4a940257a.png><p class=align-left>Elsewhere on the internet, pictures of him on a yacht named Sensation surfaced. However, that was a charter yacht and not his. Unfortunately, none of these names seems to be the actual name of the basketball player's yacht.</p><h2>Inside Shaq's new yacht</h2><p class=align-left>Is Shaq new yacht bigger than Titanic? The vessel could be bigger but not bigger than the famous Titanic. It is alleged that the vessel clocks in at 84 feet in length, which makes it relatively small in the <a href=#>world</a> of millionaire yachts.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b2408a0d50910fec.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Terence Creative Arrives in Handcuffs, Surrounded by Police During Dramatic Entrance at Wash Wash 4</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Many yachts have to reach 120 feet to be considered a superyacht. A yacht like Jeff Bezos’ Y721 is over 416 feet, making it one of the biggest yachts. Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has a 357-foot vessel that cost him a staggering $250 million.</p><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Shaq’s yacht allegedly</a> features a kitchen, a master suite and three staterooms for guests. You may have seen photos taken by paparazzi of Shaq wearing blue swim trunks with some guests in Spain from 2019. He had used it to party with friends and <a href=#>family</a> then.</p><p class=align-left>Furthermore, the vessel can accommodate 24 guests. Including its crew, it can hold a maximum of 40 people. It has multiple rooms, including the main deck, spa pool, and a well-stocked bar with stools. The yacht also has a main dining room and lounge room.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6c366ddc4b6e063b.png><p class=align-left>How much did Shaquille O Neal's yacht cost? The floating mansion, like many would love to call big yachts, reportedly costs approximately $130 million.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1db6d77b15a409a1.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Is Shannon Sharpe gay?

Unfortunately, there is little and unclear information regarding Shaq's yacht. The retired basketball player has been spotted aboard several yachts and has never claimed any to be his. Therefore, it is unclear whether he owns one.</p><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke also shared an article on <a href=#>Akothee's house</a> in Mombasa.
