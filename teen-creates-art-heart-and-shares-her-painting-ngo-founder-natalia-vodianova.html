In January, the 16-year-old artist created a painting of Natalia Vodianova, who founded the Naked Heart Foundation, a charity dedicated to creating a more inclusive society for disabled youth.
Last month, Claire met Vodianova and gave her the painting. “It was a surreal experience,” said the Year 11 student at German Swiss International School."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

To me, she is an angel with a big, naked heart that she shares with those who need it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/24/b0c4eaac-78b6-4024-b6df-11f2c68823c3_d40e4bb7.jpg><h3 data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-7 class="css-i8mw3r e76wnxb17">How it all began</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The painting began as a piece for Claire’s final exam in her art class. She was tasked with using the word “lock” as inspiration. “The teacher said, ‘Try to not draw a physical lock’,” the student recalled. “So, I explored lots of locks: two interlocking eyes [or] interlocking fingers.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Claire’s inspiration ultimately came from her community service. For about a year, she had been tutoring younger students in less affluent parts of Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After struggling to teach a student with special educational needs, Claire felt that she had helped him “unlock” his learning potential. It inspired her to think about the importance of unlocking opportunities for those with disabilities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The artist remembered hearing about the Naked Heart Foundation and decided to base her project on its founder. In January, she created the painting during her eight-hour exam. Titled Naked Heart, it uses earthy tones to depict Vodianova, who bears angel wings.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Two months later, Vodianova was visiting Hong Kong to host a children’s charity ball in Tsim Sha Tsui. Since Claire’s father was invited to the ball, the teen was able to meet her muse and give her the painting.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m just really grateful that I was able [to do this] because not all families have these connections,” she said. “That’s why I want to use this to help others.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I find that raising awareness is a way also to help other people.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Use the puzzle below to test your knowledge of the vocabulary words in the story.</p><h3 data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-22 class="css-i8mw3r e76wnxb17">Suggested Answers</h3><ul data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-23 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94312" readability=4.5><li data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94311" readability=4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What are some small and big ways to help out an important cause?
