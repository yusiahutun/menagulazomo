The model is active on her social media but it was hard to trace about any guy linked to her through her social media as well.</p><p>McKinney one stated when asked about her relationship,</p><p>“I am so single right now. It’s so funny. I’m like, even in hair and makeup, I’m like, ‘I am so single, it’s crazy.’ Usually, I have some little things here and there. Starting this year off, I’ve been really focused on work. But I’m really out there, I’m open, I’m here!”</p><p>McKinney has portrayed in numerous movies and music videos and appeared in no less than five movies last year. She is making sure that she is keeping herself as busy as last year.</p><p>Details about her personal life have not much been out in open and let us hope that she finds someone loving in her life soon enough.</p><h2>Charlotte McKinney's Romantic Life With Her Former Boyfriends, Whom Has She Dated?</h2><p>McKinney has not stayed away from short-term flings for too long. Well, she was previously linked to actor <a href=#>Scott Eastwood</a>. The former couple was spotted several times in 2016 but they denied the fact that they were dating.</p><p>US Weekly reported in October 2016 that McKinney and Eastwood were spotted kissing and walking hand-in-hand in Malibu beach.</p><p>&nbsp;<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/09/dailymail2312.jpg alt="Charlotte McKinney" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Charlotte and Scott spotted kissing in Malibu beach</strong></p><p><strong>Source: DailyMail</strong></p><p>A source reported when asked about their relationship,</p><p>“They are definitely not dating.&nbsp;They’ve hung out a couple of times – they barely know each other yet. [It’s] Nothing serious at all."</p><p>When asked about her relationship with Scott she said,</p><p>“We talk all the time. He’s always filming somewhere, I’m doing something, so whenever we can see each other, we see each other. But [he’s] just a good friend of mine.”</p><p>But looking at their romance on the beach does not quite affirm from their statement. The supermodel also took her beau in a <a href=#>Tinashe</a>'s concert in Vegas over the weekend.&nbsp;No matter what the&nbsp;supermodel says about their relationship but looking at all the activites the duo had with each other in the past certainly makes up for a short-term fling.</p><p>&nbsp;<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/09/hollywoodlife23.jpg alt="Charlotte McKinney" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Charlotte and Scott dated for a year before ending their relationship</strong></p><p><strong>Source: Hollywood Life</strong></p><p>As an attractive person, McKinney has been with quite a guy in her life.
