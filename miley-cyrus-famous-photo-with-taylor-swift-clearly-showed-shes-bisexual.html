The series went on for four seasons from 2006 to 2011. It took Miley a couple of years after that to talk about her sexuality openly. In 2015, the Plastic Hearts singer came out as pansexual.</p><p>“My whole life, I didn’t understand my own gender and my own sexuality. I always hated the word ‘bisexual,’ because that’s even putting me in a box. I don’t ever think about someone being a boy or someone being a girl,” Miley said that time in an interview.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-613637448-765x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-used-to-be-young-celebrating-who-we-will-become>“Used to Be Young; celebrating who we will become”</h2><p>Miley Cyrus has been sharing her life through the TikTok series “Used To Be Young” which is also a single of the pop queen who shared that the song holds a special place in her heart.
