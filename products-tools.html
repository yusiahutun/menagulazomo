"This type of grip could prevent finger cramping during longer tweezing sessions," she explains. The stainless steel material is also durable yet lightweight to eliminate any tension while pulling stray hairs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The grip itself comes in a variety of bright colors, making the tweezers easy to find in a fully stocked makeup bag or cluttered medicine cabinet.

"I didn't need to use any force or pressure to pluck tiny hairs," our tester says. They don't just remove hairs with ease, though. These tweezers are also great for extracting splinters, thorns and shards of glass.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One thing the tester called out is the size of the tweezers.

They have slanted-tip pincers on one end and a small brush on the other to help shape and style brows with one tool. Brush your brows upward before plucking so you can see where you need to tweeze, and then again after to position brows into place.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"The entire tool feels strong — I don't feel the need to grip or pull the hairs too hard," our tester explains.

Check out this set from Tweezerman. The trio comes with miniature slanted-tip, pointed-tip, and flat-tip tweezers, as well as a leather carrying case that is compact enough to fit inside toiletry bags and carry-ons. "I'd recommend these tweezers in a heartbeat — especially for travel, since they're so small," our tester says.

After honing in on online ratings, we spent 24 hours putting the 18 most popular tweezers to the test. We had each of our testers try the tweezers so that they could analyze the performance of each one and write down their insights during the process. In doing so, our testers rated each pair of tweezers on a scale of 1 to 5 for three key categories: ease of use, grip, and overall performance. Once the data was collected, we were able to narrow down the original pool of products to the five best tweezers.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Tamara Staples</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Tip Shape</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Each tip shape serves different purposes. Pointed tips are the most precise and are especially helpful in removing hair stubble, ingrown hairs or splinters (our favorite is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Tweezerman Point Tweezer</a>). Because of the fine tip, these types of tweezers generally provide more control when plucking. Slanted tips, on the other hand, offer more flexibility in plucking stray hairs. According to eyebrow expert <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Joey Healy</a>, these types of tips are great for grooming eyebrows. No matter what tip shade you choose, Healy recommends looking for a pair that has good "bounce back." A term Healy made up for tweezers with a bit of resistance, but still close all the way. We've all tried tweezers that were difficult to open and close and it made tweezing even more of a pain.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Size and Material</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When shopping for tweezers, you'll also want to factor in size and material. "You want to find a tweezer that feels comfortable in your hand," Healy says. "For me, I prefer full-length tweezers versus short mini ones. In addition to a variety of lengths, tweezers also come with both wide and narrow grip options for your fingers and thumb to rest on while plucking. Lastly, look for a pair made of stainless steel. This material won't rust, is easy to clean, and is the most hygienic option.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Extra Features</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Tweezer tips can be sharp, so it's important to protect yourself from being poked when searching for them in your kit. Consider looking for options that come with protective covers (like our Best Overall pick, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Anastasia Beverly Hills Tweezers</a>). These coverings are designed to fit over the sharp point of the tweezers to prevent injury and ensure that the tips don't become dull after repeated contact with other tools in your stash. "Tweezers won't dull because of your skin," Healy says. "What will dull them is dropping them on the floor, throwing them in a cosmetics bag, or putting them in a drawer where they bounce around and hit other things."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What are tweezers used for?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Tweezers are primarily used for grooming eyebrows and removing stray facial hairs.

And, according to Healy, the result is better than other hair removal alternatives. "Sometimes, with threading or waxing, the hair can break and cause painful ingrowns," he says. "But with tweezing, you pull each hair one at a time in the direction of the hair growth so that it doesn't break or turn and grow back into the skin."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because tweezing involves plucking small hairs one by one, it can be tedious and only practical for limited areas like the eyebrows, chin, and nose, or to clean up stray hairs where another removal technique has been used.

To remove hair with tweezers, it's recommended that you use a mirror in bright lighting. "Hold the tweezers in your dominant hand and a brush or spoolie in your other hand," Healy explains. "Then, comb through the brows and use the tweezer to pull individual hairs, one by one." The best lighting for tweezing, believe it or not, is often your car in the daylight. So let's not judge if we see someone parked plucking their eyebrows — they're onto something.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you reduce pain while plucking eyebrows?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Healy, tweezing can be a little painful — especially in the winter if your skin is dry, or during that time of the month. "It's less painful to pluck after the shower, when your brows will be a bit more pliable and softer, making it less painful to tweeze," he says. Using counter-pressure can be helpful, too. "If you pluck a hair, try putting your finger on it right away — it can help take away the sting," he shares.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-instyle-picks></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is InStyle Picks?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Did you notice the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>InStyle Picks seal of approval</a> at the top of this story?
