In our<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> <strong>review of Gran Turismo 7</strong></a>, microtransactions were not implemented into the game at the time.

According to<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Discord user ddm</a> (which includes the full list), winnings have been cut for a total of 16 events. While two events have had the winnings drastically increased. That being said, the negatives far outweigh the positives in this respect.</p><h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-e0f71e48 gb-headline-text"><strong>What events have increased?</strong></h3><ul><li>World Touring Car 800: 24 Heures du Mans Racing Circuit: 5,000 Cr to <strong>70,000 Cr</strong></li><li>World Touring Car 800: Monza Circuit: 5,000 Cr to <strong>70,000 Cr</strong></li></ul><h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-4474fbed gb-headline-text"><strong>What events have decreased?</strong></h3><ul><li>World Rally Challenge: Alsace Village: 50,000 Cr – <strong>30,000 Cr</strong></li><li>American Clubman Cup 700: Special Stage Route X: 30,000 Cr – <strong>15,000 Cr</strong></li><li>American FR Challenge 550:&nbsp; Blue Moon Bay Speedway: 15,000 Cr – <strong>10,000 Cr</strong></li><li>Clubman Cup Plus: Goodwood: 35,000 Cr – <strong>12,000 Cr</strong></li><li>Clubman Cup Plus: Tsukuba Circuit: 35,000 Cr – <strong>25,000 Cr</strong></li><li>Dirt Champions: Colorado Springs Lake: 65,000 Cr – <strong>40,000 Cr</strong></li><li>Dirt Champions: Sardegna Windmills: 65,000 Cr – <strong>40,000 Cr</strong></li><li>GT Cup Gr. 3: Autodrome Lago Maggiore: 75,000 Cr – <strong>50,000 Cr</strong></li><li>GT Cup Gr. 3:&nbsp; Spa Francorchamps: 75,000 Cr – <strong>50,000 Cr</strong></li><li>GT Cup Gr. 4: Brands Hatch GP Circuit: 65,000 Cr – <strong>45,000 Cr</strong></li><li>GT Cup Gr. 4: HIgh-Speed Ring: 65,000 Cr – <strong>35,000 Cr</strong></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/WbhPE2MFobA/hqdefault.jpg><p>It’s certainly a shady practice in my opinion, and I’m struggling to see how these changes are for the benefit of the player. Especially when millions of fans have already bought the game as well as investing hours of time.</p><p>The only positive I can see here is in favour of the publisher and the developer, as it might push more fans to purchase microtransactions. Even more so now that it’s harder to earn cars in-game.</p><h2 class="gb-headline gb-headline-a827ca10 gb-headline-text">Wait, There’s more?!</h2><p>Furthermore, due to online maintenance, Gran Turismo 7 has been offline for over a day. I’ve just loaded up GT7 and at the time of writing, you’re still not able to access the vast majority of its features.</p><p>While you can play certain aspects of Gran Turismo 7 offline, you’re pretty much restricted to arcade races. So, this, along with the microtransaction controversy has seemingly sparked gamers to review bomb GT7.</p><p>Posts have not only been made on<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Reddit</a> to encourage gamers to review bomb Gran Turismo 7, but the game currently has a user score of 3.8 on<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Metacritic</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamebyte.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/341e0269-gt7_ford_gt_lm_race_car_spec_ii_high-speed-ring_02_-scaled.jpg><p>Hopefully, with so many making their voices heard, the developers at Polyphony Digital will make a U-turn on lowering its rewards as well as offering a form of in-game compensation for locking players out of the game’s features.</p><p>What are your thoughts on this recent GT7 controversy?
