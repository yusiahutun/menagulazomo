Um, 'All That' -- back for the season 11, so I just finished that."</p><p>Although he said he isn't involved with <a href=#><strong>"Dancing with the Stars,"</strong></a> Judd admitted he is rooting for Nickelodeon alum, <a href=#><strong>Kel Mitchell</strong></a>, for the upcoming season.</p><p>"I have to do is give it up to Kel Mitchell though," Judd said.
