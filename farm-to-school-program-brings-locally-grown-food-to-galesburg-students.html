The Galesburg CUSD #205 is participating in the Farm to School program, a nationwide movement funded through the USDA that promotes and serves locally grown and produced food in school cafeterias.
The district began participating in the program at the beginning of the 2023 school year. It allows schools to buy food grown or produced within a 400-mile radius and encourages purchasing food from historically underserved producers and processors."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It expanded to purchasing protein items from several local farms as the season began to change, including Sumner Point Beef in Warren County, Circle S Farm in Mercer County and England Family Farms in Oneida.</p><p>“The items we purchase from local growers are currently featured in menu items at Galesburg Senior High School,” said Matt Davis, Food Service Director. “It is our intent that if the funding for the program continues, we will expand the menu items to each school in the district.”</p><p>Featured items include select produce on the salad bar, as well as local beef used in lasagna and casseroles. According to Davis, “Sourcing food items from the local region is an exciting first step in creating a resilient local food chain,” said Davis. The district plans to continue supporting local businesses by providing students with locally grown fruits, vegetables and proteins.</p><p>For more information on the Farm to School program, click <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaJ2aqp1iwbB50pyfqKecYr2zu8armKZlkqe2r7PSZqOom5Ghubp5xqumsKZdm7ywsIytpmafkaGytK7Uq55mq6Sqsaa606xm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
