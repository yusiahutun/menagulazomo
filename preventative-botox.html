As an experienced aesthetic doctor, she performs this treatment when “you can see where lines are going to develop, but they aren’t yet there at rest.” Ergo, preventative toxin is used for lines that have started to linger, but deep creases have not yet formed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dr Jennifer Owens, another cosmetics expert who you’ll find at <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://theglowclinic.ie/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Glow Clinic" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Glow Clinic</a> in Dublin and on digital dermatology platform <u><a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.getharley.com data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=GetHarley.com data-vars-ga-product-id=f0b49236-d9fa-4aaf-af0a-293b3ff1c41e data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=http://www.getharley.com data-product-url=http://www.getharley.com data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.getharley.com" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand=getharley.com data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=f48d7a9f-1377-4b02-9b7f-514ebd764417 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=getharley.com class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">GetHarley.com</a>,</u> says she has noticed a large increase in requests for treatments like this in the last couple of years. “I think one reason is that a lot of people are working from home and not wearing make-up for the most part – which means make-up isn't sitting into these lines. The contrast, then, when they do put on make-up tends to be more stark; a lot of people are complaining that they look worse, not better, and are understandably unhappy about it.”</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Who the experts say preventative toxin injections are for</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As Dr Owens explains, neuromodulators works to relax the muscles that crease the skin and, when you have enough repeated creasing, you'll get lines. Therefore, “If we relax some overly expressive muscles, we get less creasing of the skin, and prevent lines forming as quickly (or potentially at all).” The goal is not to completely freeze the muscles, simply to mellow them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She says that preventative toxin injections are best suited to someone who is very likely to get deep, or a lot of, wrinkles. How can you tell if this will be the case? “This can be someone who can see their mother or other family member has deep or an excessive number of expression lines. Also, very expressive faces tend to get more lines and get them earlier, as will thinner, finer skin (as opposed to thicker, oilier skin).”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s not about age, adds Dr Shotter, rather “it depends on the skin condition of the individual". However, she notes that "there would only be exceptional cases where the use of Botox or similar would be indicated under the age of 25”. She explains that it’s pointless for anyone whose lines are not at all visible yet, as well as for those with more established lines and wrinkles – “they would follow a corrective and not a preventative approach,” she explains.</p><img alt="nina ricci backstage paris fashion week womenswear" title="Nina Ricci : Backstage - Paris Fashion Week Womenswear Fall/Winter 2017/2018" width=3543 height=2362 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/models-are-seen-backstage-before-the-nina-ricci-show-as-news-photo-1643725343.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Lorenzo Palizzolo</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>The benefits of preventative toxin injections, according to the experts</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dr Shotter believes that if you are a suitable candidate for preventative treatments, the benefits are plain to see: “You will age with less lines and wrinkles”. As she notes, “it’s much easier to prevent than to correct”.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dr Owens suggests thinking of it this way: “If you imagine a sheet of paper that gets crumpled up, it's much harder to smooth out if it is scrunched all the way up into a ball – it would be much easier to simply not crumple it quite so much in the first place.” However, preventative toxin injections should always be approached on a case-by-case basis. “The delicate thing to balance here is choosing the appropriate time for you, your skin and your face.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"It’s much easier to prevent than to correct"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Another key benefit of preventative anti-wrinkle injections is the subtleness, Dr Owens adds. “If someone has always had ‘good skin’ and just seems to be ageing more slowly, a lot of us will put it down to them winning the genetic lottery, but it may be that they started some light Botox earlier than their peers. If, however, someone who looked fatigued for much of their 30s suddenly looks as fresh as a daisy, you're going to be thinking that they probably had a helping hand.”</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>The downsides of preventative toxin injections, according to the experts</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For something promising to maintain a youthful aesthetic, preventative toxin injections can – ironically – have the reverse effect. “I really do think that heavy Botox from a young age makes people look older,” says Dr Shotter. "An early start and heavy-handed approach can leave a face looking frozen over time.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dr Owens agrees. “I think there is a definite danger to becoming accustomed to a face that moves less and less,” adds Dr Owens. “The idea of what is normal can change, and heavy use of neuromodulators can age a younger face, resulting in an odd or distorted appearance.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Also, she says that specific areas may not be suitable for heavy treatment in the longer term, such as the frontalis muscle. “This is the muscle that raises your eyebrows and creates the horizontal lines that go across your forehead. As eyebrows drop downwards with age, over-relaxing this muscle may contribute to further or more rapid drooping of the brows over time. This would be a particular concern in someone with hooded eyelids or low-set brows to begin with.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This is why celebrity facialist and skincare expert, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://lisaharrisskinscience.co.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lisa Harris" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Lisa Harris</a> is “strongly against the idea” of preventative toxin injections. She says that “Starting at a young age and having them regularly will weaken the muscles of the face. In time the muscles will become atrophic and not be able to hold the skin up adequately. As a result this will age the skin in the long run.” In her opinion, “preventative Botox is actually speeding up the ageing process of the muscle and skin”.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In addition, Dr Owens explains that because preventative toxin injections are a relatively new phenomenon, there’s a lack of research around it. “We don't have a load of 70-year-olds that have been having micro-dosed and personalised Botox to check they turned out alright.” But, she adds, “I do think if you attend an expert, you minimise the possibility of looking extremely strange 10 or 20 years down the line.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"We don't have any 70-year-olds that have been having personalised Botox to check they turned out alright"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There is another practical downside to the taking a preventative route: the cost.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Good toxin injections are not cheap – and cheap toxin injections are usually not good!” adds Dr Owens, “and sacrificing decent, medical grade skincare or a good SPF that you wear daily is not the way to shoehorn it into your budget.” Preventative injectables typically start in your 20s, she explains, “when you may or may not be able to add this into your skincare financials”.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s something Dr Shotter echoes: “If you want to prevent, you will also be entering into a long term ‘commitment’ to Botox [or another neuromodulator] – this is a treatment that needs repeating every few months. This is the case whether you’re preventing or correcting, but it’s definitely worth thinking about.”</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Other things to consider before having toxin injectables for </strong><strong>preventative</strong><strong> reasons</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Botox isn’t meant to remove all expression, just to soften it,” says Dr Shotter, mirroring Dr Owens’ point that “a frozen face is not the goal – youthful faces move!”. So, if you’re considering preventative treatments, you want to make sure you’re with a practitioner who can help you achieve your personal goals while maintaining a natural appearance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“You must see someone that is properly qualified (doctor, dentist or nurse prescriber, depending on which country you are in), obviously, but you also want to go to someone that ‘gets’ your look, and what is going to work well for you,” says Dr Owens. “They should be able to tell you if they think something will not be a good fit for you.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ensure you’re doing it for the right reasons, too. “Filters and Facetune are ubiquitous in social media, so it's easy to forget the fact that no one looks perfect; skin has pores, people have under-eye areas that aren't smooth and that this is all normal,” says Dr Owens. If you chase perfection you will likely never be content.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related

face or side sleepers that get sleep creases which will result in lines.”</p><h2 data-node-id=42 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Treatments</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When it comes to professional services that don’t involve injections, Harris feels that "in-clinic treatments can nurture the skin and help to prevent against premature ageing by stimulating collagen production”.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Below are her favourite professional treatments for preventing skin ageing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Thermage FLX:</strong> This is a non-invasive high-powered <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/news/a42867/radiofrequency-facials/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=radiofrequency class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">radiofrequency</a> treatment that targets the tissue under the skin, triggering collagen production. A favourite with celebrities including Oprah Winfrey and Gwyneth Paltrow, it’s a treatment that gives an instant result but one that gets better and better over time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>The Collagen Wave:</strong> This is another collagen-stimulating treatment whereby radiofrequency and ultrasound waves heat up the skin, encouraging your fibroblasts to produce new collagen and elastin. “It’s non-ablative,” Harris explains, "meaning that there’s no downtime from it, so you could have the treatment and go out that evening.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Mesotherapy: </strong>“This is an alternative to filler and wrinkle relaxing injections, working to hydrate the skin to give a plumping effect by infusing a cocktail of vitamins into the epidermis. The micro-injections will also activate collagen synthesis, firming and toning the tissues while rehydrating skin.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Oxygen facials: </strong>Dehydration is a huge contributor to fine lines, and hydrating treatments like oxygen <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/g12815192/best-facials/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=facials class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">facials</a> are good at preventing dehydration in the skin. "It’s only when we get older that collagen slacks and lines stay – this is where you want to upgrade your treatments into your muscle-toning radiofrequency combined with mesotherapy," (as above).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>LED light therapy: </strong>“By stimulating the fibroblast cells within the skin, LED treatments can increase circulation, speed up tissue repair, reduce inflammation and generally improve skin texture and appearance,” Harris says.
