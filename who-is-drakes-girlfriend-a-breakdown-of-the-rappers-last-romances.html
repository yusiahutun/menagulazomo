Aubrey Drake Graham popularly referred to as “Drake,” is one of his generation’s most successful recording artists. The Canadian-born rapper and TV star hold the record as one of the most-streamed musicians in history.
The handsome Canadian first gained attention by starring as a teen in the series “Degrassi: The Next Generation.” But his musical talents became evident in 2009 with the release of  his mixtape “So Far Gone."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

A Breakdown of The Rapper's Last Romances</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-06-13</div><p><strong>After parting ways with Johanna Leia, Drake reportedly has a new beau. But who is Drake’s latest girlfriend?</strong></p><p>Aubrey Drake Graham popularly referred to as “Drake,” is one of his generation’s most successful recording artists. The Canadian-born rapper and TV star hold the record as one of the most-streamed musicians in history.</p><p>The handsome Canadian first <a href=#>gained </a>attention by starring as a teen in the series “Degrassi: The Next Generation.” But his musical talents became evident in 2009 with the release of&nbsp; his mixtape “So Far Gone.”&nbsp;</p><p>The mixtape contained hit songs like “Best I Ever Had,” which peaked at number 2 on the Billboard 100 singles chart. Also, the song “Successful,” featuring Lil Wayne and Trey Songz, went gold.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/dd/c2/60/ddc260a35ff9054a0b9b9acaa39888b3.jpg><p>Since then, Drake has dominated airwaves with top-charting R&B ingrained hip hop songs. However, music is not the only thing Drake has made headlines for. The veteran hip-hop star is a renowned playboy in the music industry.</p><p>Drake has been involved in multiple high-profile romantic relationships. The rapper has dated Rihanna, Serena Williams, and Jennifer Lopez, to name a few. As of 2022, the rapper reportedly has a new girlfriend.</p><p>In this article, we’ll examine his last four romantic relationships and try to uncover his latest beau.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Drakes_Girlfriend></span><strong>Who Is Drake’s Girlfriend?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Drizzy Drake reportedly has a new girl in his life. The “Certified Lover Boy,” who was previously in a relationship with Johanna Leia, has apparently moved on with an unknown woman.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CVfLk3xFeVL/</p></figure><p>The mystery woman, originally from Canada, now reportedly <a href=#>lives </a>in Miami. She also arranged for a Palestinian-Canadian dabke group to sing for him at his&nbsp; Narcos-themed 35th birthday party in Los Angeles. Some famous people at the “Chico Amate” party include Jack Harlow, Offset, J.Cole, and Future.</p><p>Drake has kept this new fling a secret so far, and we’ll probably have to scour his lyrics for more information. The rapper is known for name-dropping his flings on some of his songs.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Drake_and_Johanna_Leia></span><strong>Drake and Johanna Leia</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The links between Drake and model Johanna Leia started in June 2021. The pair were first spotted at the Sierra Canyon basketball game. Most people didn’t suspect anything between the two since Johanna was there to support her son Sierra Canyon star, Amari Bailey.</p><p>However, that feeling quickly changed when a helicopter caught Drake and Johanna having dinner at the Dodger Stadium. The rapper had <a href=#>rented </a>out the entire stadium for their romantic date.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/0b/27/4e/0b274e68f873df47903992cbe2a7aeba.jpg><p>The two had dinner on the field in the empty stadium. Afterward, Drake appeared courtside at some of Amari’s high school games. However, months later in October, Johanna’s absence at Drake’s 35th birthday party sparked breakup rumors.</p><p>The news of their breakup didn’t remain a rumor for long after an insider confirmed the two had parted ways. Although the details about their breakup remain a mystery, it’s not surprising; Drake hardly stays in romantic relationships for long.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Drake_and_Imaan_Hammam></span><strong>Drake and </strong><strong>Imaan Hammam</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Drake and Imaan sparked dating rumors in 2020 after the paparazzi spotted the rapper leaving her New York Apartment. The rapper <a href=#>exited </a>the model’s apartment holding two bags moments after Imaan herself walked out.</p><p>Two days later, at Imaan’s New York Fashion Week event, they couldn’t get their hands off each other. Drake reportedly gripped the hips of the supermodel who was celebrating her new collaboration with the luxury lifestyle brand “Fame.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/5d/87/f2/5d87f2209936b13a40a64020db970530.jpg><p>Imaan, born in Amsterdam to an Egyptian father and a Moroccan mother, rose to fame in 2014. The beautiful model had opened Givenchy’s spring 2014 show in Paris. She has since worked with brands like Alexander McQueen, Ralph Lauren, and Moschino.&nbsp;</p><p>Just like his previous relationships, Drake and Imaan’s romance <a href=#>ended </a>quickly. The pair stopped following one another on Instagram after Drake reportedly cheated on her with another model called Lexus.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Drake_and_Malaika_Terry></span><strong>Drake and Malaika Terry</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2018 it looked like Drake had finally found his other half in model Maliaka Terry. The two were spotted in Toronto heading into cafe Nervosa with Drake’s bodyguards in tow.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/f7/eb/38/f7eb387894d8ced2c69e286d052f00bd.jpg><p>While Drake donned a tracksuit, Malaika showed some skin in a belly-baring tube top and skin-tight blue pants. According to some sources, the two had been dating on and off for a while, and Drake took the relationship seriously. A close source <a href=#>revealed</a>:</p><p><strong>“Drake likes a lot of women, but Malaika’s special. She met [his] mom and everything. I can see him settling down with her.”</strong></p><p>Sadly, that prediction didn’t come true. It’s 2022, and more than two years since Drake and Malaika have been last linked together.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Drake_Is_Taking_Fatherhood_Seriously></span><strong>Drake Is Taking Fatherhood Seriously</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although it took a diss song for Drake to confirm he has a son, the rapper couldn’t be prouder of his mini-me. The rapper welcomed his son Adonis Graham with pornstar Sophie Brossax in 2017.</p><p>It took a while before he publicly announced his son’s birth, but he has shared multiple pictures of him since then. The little boy has also won over most of his father’s fans with his blue eyes and piercing gaze.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Cdtzgb2OeOL/</p></figure><p>Speaking about fatherhood, Drake <a href=#>disclosed </a>he never envisaged he would be a single dad. He has also called out single dad issues in his songs because he always wanted to have a family unit.</p><p>However, since Adonis is here, he would do everything in his power to be a responsible father to his son. Drake also declared his unconditional love for his son’s mother, Sophie regardless of the circumstances.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jKKqZpyilrimv4ygoKuklqe2prrDZphmmqKarqywzrClZqeWYsGpsYyrmKmolafAbrjArKtmqp%2Birq%2BvxKxm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
