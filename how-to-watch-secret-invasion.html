On the unbound energy of the series, director Ali Selem told <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://uproxx.com/tv/secret-invasion-ali-selim/>Uproxx</a>, “This show comes out of energy created by Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn. And Marvel said, “We have to keep going with that energy.” So it really started as more of a buddy cop movie put back together, and then telling a story that presumably and undeniably expands on what’s in the comic books, but the comic books are not a foundation for this.”</p><p>On returning to his role of <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1366596/when-the-marvels-come-out/>Nick Fury</a>—a character he’s played since 2009’s Iron Man, Samuel L.

They didn’t let me go to Wakanda, which I was kind of upset about. How could Nick Fury not know about Wakanda? They said, ‘Well, you do know but you can’t go.’ I always wanted to tell the story about who Nick was before he had these superhero friends — when he lived in the shadow world as a spy, and how he connected with these people.&nbsp;Secret Invasion&nbsp;is&nbsp;not&nbsp;a superhero movie. It’s gritty and dark.”</p><p>So where can fans watch Secret Invasion for free?

Secret Invasion brings back Samuel Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn into the MCU as well as introduces new (but maybe familiar?) faces into the franchise. Here’s a full list of the cast:</p><ul><li>Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury</li><li>Ben Mendelsohn as Talos</li><li>Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill</li><li>Martin Freeman as Everett Ross</li><li>Kingsley Ben-Adir as Gravik</li><li>Charlayne Woodard as Priscilla</li><li>Killian Scott as Pagon</li><li>Samuel Adewunmi as Beti</li><li>Dermot Mulroney as United States President Ritson</li><li>Christopher McDonald, to be announced</li><li>Katie Finneran, to be announced</li><li>Emilia Clarke as G’iah</li><li>Olivia Colman as Sonya Falsworth</li><li>Don Cheadle as James “Rhodey” Rhodes / War Machine</li></ul><p>Colbie Smulders who has played Maria Hill since 2012, talked about expanding her role in the mini-series to <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/03/secret-invasion-marvel-exclusive rel=nofollow>Vanity Fair.</a> “Listen, I would’ve loved<a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/culture/1366475/marvel-funko-pops/ rel="noreferrer noopener"> superpowers </a>at some point, but it’s also intriguing playing a human in this world, because you’ve made the choice to really put your life in jeopardy,” Smulders says. “This is a Marvel story where the humans can shine. Even though there are aliens, and there’s going to be extraordinary fight sequences, this is about people on the ground talking to each other, and interviewing people, and really doing hands-on work to get the information needed.”</p><p>Ben Mendelsohn, who also starred in Captain Marvel, explained the underlying themes of the show. “I think any time that you get cultures that have significant tensions between groups of people, then you can find a corollary,” says Mendelsohn. “The Cold War stuff is the big one that jumps out, but there is plenty of strife between groups of people that this addresses.”</p><p>Marvel fans see a different side to Nick Fury and the series showcases a more worn out hero. “Even Nick Fury can be shaken, you know?” Jackson told the outlet. One reason his character has been off in space, ignoring calls for help, is he doesn’t believe he can fix things anymore. “He’s up there trying to process what the fuck happened, you know? And what his place in the world is,” Jackson says. “The death of Iron Man, the death of Black Widow—with that stuff going on, he just kind of checked out.”</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
