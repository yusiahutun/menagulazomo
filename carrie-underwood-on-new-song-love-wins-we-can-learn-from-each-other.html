After a&nbsp;run of songs that deal with intense themes&nbsp;—&nbsp;alcoholism, honoring&nbsp;families of victims of gun violence — Underwood's "Love Wins" is sobering.</p><p>Sitting down with Taste of Country and other media,&nbsp;she explains how, in the convoluted world we live in where we often jump to conclusions before knowing full details, she wanted to write a song that highlights the positivity in our differences.</p><p>Underwood admits that writing "Love Wins" was "scary" at first, as she didn't want&nbsp;fans to misinterpret the meaning of the song. But&nbsp;the driving force&nbsp;was to create a message&nbsp;that&nbsp;celebrates&nbsp;uniqueness.</p><p>"I do think that we as humans are inherently good and we need to remember that.&nbsp;Because we're different, that doesn't make somebody else bad, it just makes us different,"&nbsp;Underwood&nbsp;explains. "We wanted that song to be hopeful and to maybe make somebody stop and think about that."</p><p><strong>What to Expect Now That Carrie Underwood Is Expecting</strong></p><p>Underwood observed how easy it can be to draw quick conclusions and react with anger. But&nbsp;"Love Wins"&nbsp;seeks to inspire people to speak to one another with understanding and open hearts.</p><p>"We weren't trying to speak negatively about our world, because we live in an amazing world, but I feel like we get really caught up in surface things and I feel like in this world, we're quick to get angry at each other," she says. "I personally think that we're all different for a reason. I feel like if you just sit down and talk to somebody who's not like you and keep it calm, we can all learn from each other."</p><p>Underwood hopes to instill this lesson and empathy in her children — the star is&nbsp;mother to 3-year-old son Isaiah and expecting her <a href=#>second child</a>. "I want Isaiah to be around people that don't think like he does. I want him to form his own opinions about things and I want him to talk to people and come to people with love,"&nbsp;she&nbsp;says, adding that while&nbsp;people may not always agree, talking to someone with a&nbsp;mindset different from&nbsp;their own can be eye-opening. "I feel like that's an important trait we all need more of, but definitely something that we need to teach our children to love each other and love others."<strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p><p>"Above all, we want people to feel hopeful," she says, speaking of "Love Wins." "I want to make sure people see this for what it is and what we're trying to say."</p><p>The new project arrives on Sept. 14.</p><p><strong>Carrie&nbsp;Underwood Talks About her Cry Pretty Album</strong></p><p><strong>All of Carrie Underwood's Singles, Ranked Worst to Best:&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnJmip7amedSnm56qp6S8pXnOp2SnnadiwLC6xmajqK6VYsSqutJmrp5lk5a7brjEmqmnZZanvK55xJqaoWWfqbWmvo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
