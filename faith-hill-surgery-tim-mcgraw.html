Hill posted a photo to Instagram on Nov. 10 showing her reading InStyle magazine and propping up her foot, on which she recently had surgery. The cast is visible in the background as she thumbs through an interview with southern icons Dolly Parton and Reese Witherspoon."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The cast is visible in the background as she thumbs through an interview with southern icons <a href=#>Dolly Parton</a> and Reese Witherspoon. According to Hill’s caption, the surgery is simply some work on a past injury to get her ready for touring next year.</p><p>Meanwhile, McGraw was in the kitchen cooking for his better half — from scratch, no less. The artist posted a photo in the middle of the process of making chicken and dumplings, cutting the dough in strips with a classic wooden rolling pin nearby. It's the very same homemade dish that McGraw says <a href=#>helped him win his wife's heart</a> when they first met.</p><p>The couple are gearing up to go on tour together in 2017 for their <a href=#>Soul2Soul World Tour,</a> an extensive run kicking off in April. They announced the endeavor at a <a href=#>surprise show</a> at the Ryman, originally billed under the name Sam & Audrey (their actual first names). Both artists just <a href=#>received stars</a> on the Music City Walk of Fame in Nashville.</p><p>Hill and McGraw have kept their relationship a priority over the years and shared in many milestones together, including recently sending their second daughter off to college. They <a href=#>said the experience was tough</a>, but exciting in many ways. They celebrated their 20th anniversary recently, and judging by the <a href=#>sweet lipstick note </a>Hill left for McGraw on a mirror (reminiscent of his proposal) — they are still very much in love. McGraw’s adorable photo from the CMA Awards <a href=#>captioned “Damn I’m Lucky!” </a>would suggest the same.</p><p><strong>See Tim and Faith's Best Photos Through the Years</strong></p><p><strong>Tim McGraw Talks About 20 Years With Faith</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmn5mZqbVutMilo2arpae0pr7YZquipV2isKi%2BwLBm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
