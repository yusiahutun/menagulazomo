Many were struck by the Sussexes’ counter-intuitive approach to marking the joyous holiday, which is all about family. However, while some think Meghan and Harry were just being low-key with this, it could be a well-thought-out decision to send a very strong message on the part of the former royals.</strong></p><p>It is undeniable the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have had a rather difficult year. 2021 and 2022 proved to be good for them, with their Oprah Winfrey tell-all interview and their <a href=#>Netflix</a> documentary’s release making massive waves. However, <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and Prince Harry have suffered major career setbacks as well as PR troubles this year. Now the California residents have released their 2023 Christmas card, and they may be sending a very subtle yet strong message with it.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-and-harry-thank-fans-for-support-in-christmas-card>Meghan and Harry thank fans for support in Christmas card</h2><p>The Sussexes digital card is as low effort as it gets. It resembles a wedding invite rather than a colorful and family-oriented holiday card. The pair, who suffered a major career setback this year, including <a href=#>Spotify</a> scrapping their $20 million deal, did not bother to have a dedicated photo session with their kids for their holiday card this year. This move would have also helped the Duke and Duchess save a lot of cash as they <a href=#>try to keep up the Hollywood lifestyle</a> in the billionaire’s playground that is Montecito.</p><p>Their card features a picture of Meghan and <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> from their Invictus Game’s final day’s appearance. They both have the brightest smiles on their faces as they clap their hands during the Düsseldorf event. The card reads: “On behalf of the office of Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Archewell Productions, and Archewell Foundation, We Wish you a very Happy Holiday Season.”</p><p>There is also a line that reads: “Thanks for all the support in 2023!” despite Meghan’s likeability in the US falling far below Harry’s this year. Even Prince William and <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> are more likable to Americans than their native, Meghan. A report on YouGov data <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reveals</a> Meghan was the least-liked among the former Fab Four including Harry, <a href=#>Prince William</a>, and Kate. Prince Harry received a 48% approval rating, while William had 43%. Kate stood tall at 46% but only 40% of Americans approved of Meghan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1683497427-1024x753.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sussex-s-low-key-holiday-card-is-a-well-thought-out-move>Sussex’s low-key holiday card is a well-thought-out move</h2><p>Meghan and Harry have not featured their kids <a href=#>Archie, 4, and Lilibet</a>, 2, in a holiday card for two consecutive years now. Despite a holiday card being all about family, they have kept theirs outside the media’s eye.</p><p>This is also in stark contrast with William and Kate’s Christmas card that features their three royal kids Prince George, <a href=#>Princess Charlotte</a>, and Prince Louis. While William and Kate are preparing their kids for <a href=#>royal</a> life and potentially taking up duties to serve the crown in the future, it’s different for the Sussexes.</p><p>By not releasing a single picture of Archie and Lilibet by themselves in 2023, Meghan and Harry could be sending a very strong message. That being, they do not want their little kids becoming a piece of content for the media. They most likely also want their kids to be private individuals as they are growing up away from the <a href=#>rules and regulations of the British monarchy</a>.</p><p>However, there’s a second reason why Harry and Meghan’s Christmas card looks the way it does. The Duke and Duchess are very clearly taking a professional and business-oriented approach when it comes to their public image now. They are focusing on <a href=#>building their brand</a> in the domain of entertainment, social work, and lifestyle. Hence, how they present themselves in every little aspect helps to shape the public perception of them.</p><p>Both Meghan and Harry want to be taken more seriously now, especially after South Park’s mockery of them in the episode The Worldwide Privacy Tour. The Sussexes absolutely will not stand for being reduced to caricatures for the public to laugh at. Hence gone are the days of the two dragging the British royal family in the court of public opinion.</p><p>They are also working on penetrating <a href=#>Hollywood</a>. As a result, Meghan recently announced a new contract with the talent and media agency William Morris Endeavor (WME). The agency’s clients include the likes of Christian Bale, Kate Beckinsale, Matt Damon, Jennifer Garner, <a href=#>Whoopi Goldberg</a>, Jake Gyllenhaal and many more.</p><p>Previously, some rumors also suggested the Duchess is looking to <a href=#>relaunch her lifestyle brand</a> The Tig to venture into the lifestyle and wellness space.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2aFcLvPoqWip55iuqazx5qlZqWRp7itsYyapZ1loKe2r6%2FEZp%2BaqqKuwG6vx6ugrKydlsBur8Crm2aho2LAprrDoqWgZaSsvG7CxKuwZqukp7yvs4ymnKyrkZyytHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
