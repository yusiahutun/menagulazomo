Although she made her acting debut in the family holiday film “Holiday in the Sun” in 2001, Megan Fox rose to fame several years later. Fox had her breakout role in 2007 when she played Mikaela Banes in the blockbuster action film “Transformers.”&nbsp;</p><p>Since she rose to fame, the stunning actress has appeared in several other movies and TV shows. Consequently, she has won several awards, including two Scream Awards and Four Teen Choice Awards. Her fame and success in Hollywood have spilled over to her children, who have also gained the attention of fans.</p><p>Here’s everything we know about Megan Fox’s third child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-25_04-07-15-fotor-2023072541220.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Journey_River_Green></span>Who Is Journey River Green?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Journey River Green was born to his parents in Los Angeles, California, on August 4, 2016. While his birth didn’t surprise fans, the fact that his mother was pregnant for the third time was a surprise. The actress and her ex-husband filed for divorce in August 2015. However, they called off their split and announced the pregnancy in 2016 to more than a few raised eyebrows.&nbsp;</p><p>Journey has mixed English, German, and Scottish heritage thanks to his parent’s diverse ancestry. Even though his parents have successful careers in Hollywood, they shield the 6-year-old celebrity kid from the media. Hence, there are no details regarding his education. However, considering his age, reports suggest he is in elementary school.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-25_04-06-55-fotor-202307254940.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Journey_River_Greens_Parents_Meet></span>How Did Journey River Green’s Parents Meet?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The former couple met while filming on the “Hope & Faith” set when Fox was 18. They were smitten by each other and started dating in 2004, despite the 12-year gap between them. Fox and Brian’s love blossomed quickly, and they announced their engagement in November 2006.&nbsp;</p><p>Although initially engaged, Journey’s parents called off their relationship in February 2009. However, by 2010, Fox and Brian were back together. Although the actress maintains that they have been together since their engagement in 2006, reports suggest they got engaged again on June 1, 2010. The now-separated couple tied the knot in a private wedding ceremony at the Four Seasons Resort, Maui, on June 24, 2010.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, Fox filed for divorce in 2015, a few days after she and Brian announced their separation. However, they reconciled in early 2016 and had their youngest son, Journey River Green. Their marriage ended in May 2020 when Brian announced their separation. Afterward, Fox filed for divorce in November 2020 for a second time, and their divorce got finalized on October 15, 2021.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-25_04-07-01-fotor-20230725498.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Brothers_Does_Journey_River_Green_Have></span>How Many Brothers Does Journey River Green Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Journey River Green has four brothers. He has two siblings from his parent’s marriage, Bodhi Ransom Green and Noah Shannon Green. The celebrity kid also has two half-brothers, Kassius Lijah Marcil-Green and Zane Walker Green, from his father’s two other relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>Kassius Lijah Marcil-Green is the eldest of the Green brothers. He was born on March 5, 2002, and is 21. Kassius is the product of Brian’s relationship with “Beverly Hills 90210” castmate Veronica Marcil. The former couple started dating in 1999; they became engaged in July 2001 and ended their relationship in 2003. Like his parents, Kassius has also pursued an entertainment career. He also spends time with Journey River Green and his other siblings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Next is Noah Shannon Green, the oldest of Brian Austin Green and Megan Fox’s children. Noah was born on September 27, 2012. Although he is just ten years old, Noah Shannon Green is the most controversial of the Green Brothers. Consequently, Fox described him as a “sensitive” child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-25_04-07-09-fotor-202307254830.jpg><p>After Noah comes Bodhi Ransom Green, the second child of Megan Fox and the third child of Brian. He was born at the Cedars -Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on February 12, 2014. Like his older siblings, details about the 9-year-old celebrity kid are kept private, and it is unknown if he will follow in his parent’s footsteps.&nbsp;</p><p>Last but not least is Zane Walker Green, his half-brother. Zane is the youngest of Journey’s siblings. Zane was born to Brian and his Australian professional dancer girlfriend, <a href=#>Sharna Burgees</a>, on June 28, 2022. Hence, he is one year old.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Megan_Fox_Have_a_Daughter></span>Does Megan Fox Have a Daughter?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, she doesn’t. However, the famous actress has three sons, Noah Shannon, Bodhi Ransom, and Journey River Green.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Megan_Foxs_Son_an_Actor></span>Is Megan Fox’s Son an Actor?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, he is not. As earlier stated, Journey River Green is a 6-year-old kid in his formative years. He still has a lot of growing up to do and a lot to learn before he decides on a career path to follow. Hence, it is unknown if Journey River Green will follow in his parent’s footsteps.</p><p>Another celebrity kid like Journey Green River in their formative years is Emily Blunt and John Krasinski’s daughter, <a href=#>Violet Krasinski</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kt7DB0aecsmWinsOmvoygqZ6dnmK6prHTZpicrKKawLR5zJ6emqZdm7y5v4yspqdn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
