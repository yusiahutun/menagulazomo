Though they may not appear to take up much space, these flat boards can quickly make a kitchen feel chaotic when you aren’t sure where to put them between uses. Plus, the more you have, and in different sizes, the more likely things are to get disorganized and even topple out on you like a game of Jenga when you try to reach for just one. Wondering where can you safely store clean cutting boards? Organizing pros have the answers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where can you safely store clean cutting boards?</h2><p>When it comes to storing cutting boards, there are a few of things that experts suggest you do to make sure they stay organized and sanitized.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Declutter</h3><p>First, take a look at all of the boards you have and decide which ones are worth holding onto. “I begin by bringing them all to one location and filtering down the number needed,” explains decluttering coach <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Leonard</a> of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Leonard Coaching</a> . “Begin with the ones that are damaged and can no longer be used safely or hygienically.” This is a good time to toss any that show signs of mold.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Give them air</h3><p>You’ll also want to store the boards in a well-ventilated area to prolong their life. Also smart: “Ensure there’s enough space for air circulation around the boards to prevent moisture build-up and bacterial growth,” says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Katy Wells</a>, decluttering expert and host of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Maximized Minimalist podcast</a>. It’s also a good idea to assign designated boards to different tasks (such as vegetables and meat) to reduce the risk of cross-contamination.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Take usage into account</h3><p>Finally, consider how often a board is needed when deciding where to store it. “Assign a specific spot for each board based on its frequency of use, with the most commonly used ones being the most accessible,” shares <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Aaron Traub</a>, owner and lead organizer<br>of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">My Professional Organizer Dallas</a>. “Introducing a simple labeling system on the edge of the boards can help quickly identify the right board for the job.”</p><p>Here some more clever ways and places to safely store your clean cutting boards:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Store them in file or folder organizers</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/Rack5193-1.jpg><p>Cutting boards can quickly create chaos inside a cabinet, especially when you stack them. Not only does it prevent proper air circulation, it can create a mess when you need to find the one you need. The solution: “Magazine and file holders are perfect for keeping these slender items easy to access,” promises organizer Christina Giaquinto of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Modular Closets</a>. Just pop the file holders into tight cabinets to almost double your usable space.&nbsp;</p><p>A similar option: wire storage pan organizers. “They’re intended for cooking pans but work well for storing cutting boards and giving them enough breathing space,” adds Traub. “They keep the boards neatly separated, making them easy to grab.”</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The File Folder Hack That Keeps Your Linen Closet Organized + More Brilliant Tips</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Store them on hooks</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/FFW2414HomeSol_CommandHookCuttingBoard-1.jpg><p>Prefer to keep your cutting boards tucked away but have minimal shelf room in your cabinets? No problem! “For kitchens with limited space, hanging cutting boards on the inside of cabinet doors using over the door hooks or adhesive hooks is a simple DIY option,” explains Traub. “It saves space while keeping boards out of sight but is easily accessible.”</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>The Tension Rod Shelf Secret — and 8 Other Genius Ways To Organize a Small Pantry</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Sore them on a vertical rack</h3><p>If you have quite a few boards, using the hook method might not be an effective storage method. In this case, you can still take advantage of vertical storage!</p><p>“You can use a vertical organizer or a DIY custom-built rack inside your cabinets,” suggests Wells. “This not only saves space but also keeps your boards within easy reach so you can quickly grab and go.”</p><p><strong>See this storage solution in action in the YouTube video from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">VUGAMI</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Store them in a cutting board stand</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/GettyImages-1436473923-1.jpg><p>If you don’t have much room available in your kitchen cabinets or simply find your cutting boards to be an aesthetic addition to your kitchen, consider keeping them out in the open! “Beyond cabinet storage, cutting boards can be stored on countertops using stands or leaned against the backsplash,” says Traub. “I personally love the look of a nice wooden cutting board on the countertop.” Stands are also particularly useful as they prevent the board from falling over.</p><p>Note: If you do decide to keep your cutting board on your counter when not in use, you may have to give it an extra clean if any food from meal prep splatters onto the board.

An alternative: “For those who love to show off their cutting boards, consider a magnetic wall strip or open shelving,” shares Wells. “This turns your cutting boards into part of the decor, adding a touch of rustic charm or modern simplicity, depending on your style.” &nbsp;</p><p>If you opt for open shelving, however, make sure your board is still accessible. You want to be able to grab it in a flash when you need to chop up meat or veggies!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Store them on a plate rack</h3><p>Plate racks are both an aesthetic and practical way to display and store plates, but they’re good for more than that. Leonard suggests hanging your cutting boards in a plate rack fixed to the side of a cabinet or a kitchen island. You can just grab them as needed, and they’ll stay out of the way!</p><p>If you have extra wall space in your kitchen, you can even install the racks on your wall for the storage.
