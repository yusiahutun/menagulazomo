If you are a fan of Jackie Chan, you have probably wondered what else is there to him apart from his acting. When it comes to his personal life, Jackie Chan is married to Joan Lin. Despite being a famous Taiwanese actress, Joan is not as recognizable a name in the entertainment industry as Jackie Chan, a curse that every celebrity spouse has to contend with. Besides, she likes to keep her personal space and is rarely photographed.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b1085c4811af0ae6.jpg><p class=align-left>However, there is much more to Joan Li than being Jackie Chan’s wife.

Here is a look in to her personal and professional life as well as her marriage to Jackie Chan.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Jordyn Taylor: 7 things to know about Trevor Noah's former girlfriend</p><h3>How old is Joan Lin?</h3><p class=align-left>Joan Lin, born Joan Lin Feng-jiao, is 66 years old. She was born on June 30, 1953, in the province of Taipei, Taiwan. She was the second born out of a family of 5 children.</p><h3>Joan Lin's early life</h3><p class=align-left>Joan Lin might be a successful actress, but she was not always rich. At the time of her birth, Taiwan was a haven for poverty. She was born into a poor family, and she (and her siblings) grew up without many of life’s comfort. Things were so bad for her family that she had to drop out of school at the age of 12 after her parents were unable to continue funding her education. However, events would later turn into her favour, when she got an acting role at the age of 19.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4f73ab4630959f67.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sidney Starr: real name, partner, life story, before and after pictures</span></p></a><h3>Joan Lin parents and siblings</h3><p class=align-left>While Lin is a recognizable actress with several films to her name, little is known about her personal life with regards to her parents and siblings. The only information about her available is that she was born in Taiwan in a family of seven. Not much else is known about her parents and siblings, and her early years – only that they were poor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/12aa27019e1c27f6.jpeg><h3>Jackie Chan and Joan Lin Feng-jiao</h3><p class=align-left>Lin is perhaps best known for the fact that she married Jackie Chan, one of the most recognizable names in the entertainment industry. He is especially a big hit in Hollywood, where he is famous for his roles in blockbuster films such as The Spy Next Door, Rush Hour, Shanghai Noon, Rumble in the Bronx, Karate Kid, and others.</p><p class=align-left>Joan Lin and Jackie Chan first met in 1981 and started dating soon afterward. At the time of their meeting, Chan was still an upcoming actor in Hollywood, while Lin was already an established star in Taiwan.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7694a50c12cbe620.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Carol Kane: Husband, kids, net worth, movies, personal life</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Anna Torv measurements, husband, children and hot photos</p><p class=align-left>Lin got pregnant a few months after they started dating, which led the couple to relocate to the USA and get married. The marriage ceremony – held on December 1, 1981 - was a low key event that was quickly put together. In fact, they tied the knot in L.A coffee shop. The reason for the quick wedding was that they wanted to be married before they welcomed their baby – which is not surprising given that Lin gave birth to her son on December 3, 1981.</p><h3>Joan Lin children</h3><p class=align-left>Joan Lin and Jackie Chan family is quite small; given that they only have a single child together. The child’s name - a son – is Jaycee Chan Joming.</p><h2>What happened to Jackie Chan's son?</h2><p class=align-left>Jaycee Chan Joming (age 36 years) is a Hong Kong singer and actor. He is especially known for performing in Cantonese and Mandarin. Jaycee started on his career in 2003, at age 21, after dropping out of school and moving to Hong Kong. In 2004, he released his first CD album. He also made his first acting debut in the film Twin Effects II, a film in which his father made a cameo appearance.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0bc4671e747ea4b0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rosemary Margaret Hobor: What you never knew about John Candy's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Jaycee continued with his career, working with alongside his father in several film projects. However, despite Chan's involvement and Jaycee being entertainment industry royalty, most of his albums and movies did not perform well enough. His career was further troubled by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">his arrest and imprisonment</a> in 2014, where he was charged with drug possession and accommodating drug use (for inviting friends to smoke marijuana in his apartment). Currently, Jaycee is currently on a hiatus from the entertainment industry.</p><h2>Is Jackie Chan still married to Joan Lin?</h2><p class=align-left>Yes, Jackie Chan and Joan Lin are still married even today. However, their marriage has been rocked by several problems, mostly as a result of Chan cheating on Lin. He was rumoured to have cheated on Lin several times, but the most infamous incident was his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">affair with Elaine Ng</a>. The affair resulted in a child, Eta Ng, who is estranged from Chan.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0acafd27b67b7869.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sydnee Goodman bio: nationality, married, IGN, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Aside from the affair and rumours of cheating, Chan and Lin's marriage has also been rocked by a number of other problems, mostly resulting from the martial arts superstar's dark side. In a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tell-all biography</a>, Chan describes details of his less-than-admirable behaviour. He has admitted to the affair with Elaine in the biography, excessive drinking, abuse, and other issues. The fact that both Joan Lin and Jackie Chan married after the unexpected pregnancy for the sake of their son’s future showed another issue with the couple’s marriage. In a 2015 interview, Chan admitted that he felt that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">he had to marry Joan Lin</a> after the pregnancy.</p><p class=align-left>However, despite all the hurdles the couple has gone through, and especially the much-publicized cheating scandal, they are still married to this day.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Andrea Roth bio: Age, measurements, net worth and hottest photos</p><h2>Joan Lin career</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0d65255152b05f3f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Christine Taylor: 10 quick facts to know about Ben Stiller's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Joan Lin started her acting career at 19, just seven years after dropping out of school. Her first role was in the film, The Hero of Chiu Chow. The film was a huge success commercially, and this helped to open up more opportunities for her acting career. Within no time, her star flourished, and she became one of the household names in the Taiwanese entertainment industry. Her career lasted for 10 years, during which she featured in a total of 70 films. Some of the most memorable films she has starred in include: Shaolin Vengeance, My Native Land, The Story of A Small Town, the Battle for the Republic of China, Devil Returns, He Never Gives Up, and others.</p><p class=align-left>After relocating to the US and marrying Jackie Chan, Lin left the entertainment industry. However, by then she had already made a name for herself, and even though she did not break out in Hollywood, she is still a star in Taiwan as several other countries where her films had a huge following.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a9c83be9af6879ad.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sofia Richie bio: net worth, photos, boyfriend, Instagram, age</span></p></a><h2>Joan Lin net worth and salary</h2><p class=align-left>Since Joan Lin's career was in Taiwan, combined with the fact that she has not appeared in the entertainment industry for decades, there is little information about how much money she used to make. However, given the fact that she was one of the top stars of the Taiwanese entertainment industry, her individual net worth is quite significant.</p><p class=align-left>The fact that she is married to Jackie Chan, one of the top-earning actors in the world also means that her martial wealth is quite huge. Chan was listed in the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Forbes top 100 celebrity earners</a> in 2019, with an annual salary of $58 million. Chan’s net worth in 2019 is also approximately <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$400 million</a>, which means that Joan Lin enjoys a very comfortable lifestyle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4f73ab4630959f67.png><h2>Joan Lin house and properties</h2><p class=align-left>Jackie Chan and Joan Lin own <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">several houses</a> and properties all over the world.

However, her greatest achievement would not come until 1979, where she won the Best Leading Actress award in the 16th Golden Horse Awards for her role in the film, The Story of a Small Town. The previous year, Lin had been nominated for the same award for her role in the film, He Never Gives Up, but she did not win.</p><p class=align-left>Joan Lin is mostly known for being Jackie Chan's wife. However, there is a lot more to this sensational former actress. And although she has not appeared on the big screen for several years now, her roles in the Taiwanese film industry are still recognized to this day. What is even more amazing is how she has managed to overcome several hardships over the years, from poverty that saw her drop out of school, unexpected pregnancy when she was still not married, and a rocky marriage due to her husband’s affair.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9c3d1b587c242a2d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Exclusive: Amber Ray age, child, cars, house, is she married?</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Jane Leeves measurements, weight loss, children, husband, net worth</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FkGlrbnFdn7yiuoyloKdlmpawrLXEZpqhmZ6oeri1xZ5km6GfYq6osYycn6KklKeyr3rHraSl</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
