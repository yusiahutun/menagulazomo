The pair also provided a seemingly authentic marriage certificate showing they wed in the southern Philippines in 2022, yet an inspection of the man’s travel records revealed he was not in the country at that time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The man later admitted to paying a China-based agency 40,000 pesos to process the documents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Four such couples have been intercepted so far this year, according to immigration officials, who expressed particular concern over their ability to produce authentic documents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Initial investigations by the immigration bureau’s anti-fraud section showed the certificates were “seemingly original”, deputy spokesman Melvin Mabulac told media on March 7, prompting the Department of Justice, as head of the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking, “to further conduct a probe on how these documents have been released”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This Week in Asia has contacted the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking and Bureau of Investigation for comment.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">What the Bureau of Immigration should investigate is who is issuing these marriage certificatesNathalie Africa-Verceles, academic</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nathalie Africa-Verceles, a professor at the University of the Philippines’ Department of Women and Development Studies, said the presence of legitimate marriage documents suggested the involvement of organised crime groups in the trafficking scheme.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“What the Bureau of Immigration should investigate is who is issuing these marriage certificates,” she said, adding that the number of women being trafficked into marriage could be much higher than the recent interceptions suggest.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The fact that [the Filipino woman and Chinese national] had a legal document is concerning, because there was obviously some corruption there, because how else do you obtain a legal marriage certificate?”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Limited resources and training could hamper law enforcement agencies’ ability to identify trafficking cases, especially if organised crime syndicates are involved, according to Ross Tugade, a human rights lawyer and professor of international law at the University of the Philippines.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/18/1b64a625-bb2f-4f28-8252-8e6574c3a6e1_86c7776f.jpg>“It might be the case that authorities are better equipped to identify cases involving forced labour or obvious sex trafficking, but might miss more nuanced scenarios like mail-order bride exploitation,” she said, adding that <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">China’s gender imbalance</span></a> could be driving demand for mail-order brides.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Traffickers also constantly adapt their methods. They shift operations, move online, and find loopholes to exploit. Laws often struggle to keep up with these tactics.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Philippines has laws specifically designed to combat human trafficking. The Anti Mail-Order Bride Law of 1990, and its replacement the Anti Mail-Order Spouse Act of 2016, prohibits the business of organising or facilitating the marriage of Filipino women to foreign men by matchmaking services. There is also the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003, which was expanded in 2022 to provide authorities with more oversight and enhanced penalties for violations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But experts say these laws are only as good as their implementation.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Trafficking, ‘love scams’: inside raided Chinese gaming firm in the Philippines</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Do a lot of women know about these laws? Or, given their economic exigencies [needs], do these laws even matter to them? We have a lot of laws and if they were implemented properly, it would really improve the condition of Filipino women,” Africa-Verceles said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She said young women on low incomes with low educational attainment, particularly those who had been internally displaced, were the most vulnerable to being trafficked.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jean Enriquez, executive director of the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women – Asia-Pacific, told This Week in Asia that the marriage trafficking scheme could be connected to the surge in Chinese investments into Philippine offshore gaming operations (POGO) that reached its height under the previous administration of former president Rodrigo Duterte.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At its peak, the POGO industry employed around 300,000 Chinese workers in the Philippines taking advantage of loose regulations on gambling businesses to cater to customers in mainland China. It has been linked to a slew of crimes and controversies, from cases of abduction, tax evasion and bribery to sex dens, prostitution rings, and torture chambers being uncovered by authorities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/18/d8284bc9-f91a-47ee-af9c-a331b42774b1_d497e782.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A March 13 raid on a POGO compound in Tarlac province, around 100km north of Manila, uncovered a potential hub for love scams, with 373 Filipinos being rescued amid allegations of human trafficking and illegal detentions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In November, authorities also rescued 15 Filipino women – including five suspected to be underage – from an alleged prostitution den in Pasay City catering to Chinese POGO workers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Women are lined up in “aquarium”-like chambers at such facilities to be picked out by “POGO employees and their bosses” and used as “sex slaves”, Philippine Senator Risa Hontiveros told a November Senate hearing after touring a raided POGO hub. “I could hardly stop crying when I saw,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Anti-trafficking campaigner Enriquez said the revelations about raided POGO hubs “point to the targeting of Filipino women by customers from China for sexual exploitation”.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/11/26/Clean_Thumbnail.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">13:19</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">The dark world of Asia’s online casino industry</p><p>The dark world of Asia’s online casino industry</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Women being trafficked to China was a “historical phenomenon rooted in China’s patriarchal demand”, she said, with Southeast Asian nations “such as Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam used as source areas for women to be sexually exploited”.</p>China’s <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">one-child policy</span></a>, which began in 1980 and ended in 2016, resulted in there being an estimated 35 million more men than women in the country, making it challenging for Chinese men to find a wife, Enriquez said.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The supply side is pushed by the women’s poverty in source countries like the Philippines and the neighbouring Mekong subregion, which is being exploited by traffickers and buyers, as patriarchal stereotypes prey on the pressure for women to marry and save their families from poverty through marriage,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Enriquez said trafficking will continue to be an issue until the Philippines starts to hold the buyers of women accountable. “Until now, those convicted are third-party traffickers and we have yet to hear of male procurers being punished, even as the practice has been normalised,” she said, citing the example of websites offering catalogues of Filipino “brides” available for purchase. She said the owners of such websites could be prosecuted under the 2022 anti-trafficking law.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China’s one-child policy and the millions of ‘missing girls’</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But ultimately, Enriquez said, curbing trafficking cases is a two-way street.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“While the Philippines must create local sustainable jobs and ensure that accessible support is provided for susceptible communities of women and girls, China must address its own demand side – patriarchal policies and culture which socialises men as perpetrators.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2mu8%2BlnGiZoqm2pLjEaGprbWVsgHl7xaKjoqiZo7xuucCio2anopmys3nBq6CdnaNiwbOtxZ%2BgnKOVmXqktMinmGaZnJa%2FrnnPoaCloaCltq%2Bx0mamr52iYrmqusqsZJygmaOytLGMqKmgmZ6ewKawjJypoqWV</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
