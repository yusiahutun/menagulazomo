Even in this casual number, he’s leaping, jumping, grinding, and whacking away at the floor. The dance moves never get repetitive, and he brings his entire <i>Don Jon</i> sexuality to bear on the performance. And, as with his performance of Nicki Minaj’s “Super Bass,” his lip-sync of Ludacris’s rap verse is airtight. Meanwhile, Anthony Mackie introduces his lip-sync of of Katy Perry’s “I Kissed a Girl” by saying, “College was a great time for me because of this song,” which immediately tries to jettison the very queer nature of having a straight man sing this song. That aside, it’s just a messy performance, with Mackie getting the timing off. Back to training camp for you, Falcon.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-715fa246ad5b90090cecd80d43ea903e-6-0-0@published data-word-count=7><strong>Winner:</strong> Joseph Gordon-Levitt, by a floor hump.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-715fa246ad5b90090cecd80d43ea903e-7-0-0@published data-word-count=13><strong>Battle 2: Anthony Mackie’s “2 Legit 2 Quit” vs. Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s “Rhythm Nation”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-715fa246ad5b90090cecd80d43ea903e-9-0-0@published data-word-count=159>Mackie does a perfectly serviceable rendition of MC Hammer’s “2 Legit 2 Quit.” On another episode, it might have even been good. But if he’s going to come for the king, he better bring it hard. So ultimately, his performance is just a warm-up for the one we’ve all been waiting for, JGL doing Janet Jackson’s “Rhythm Nation” — a monumental, ambitious choice. It’s all there: the inspirational words about racial equality at the beginning, the costumes, and the choreography. But what’s great about Levitt’s performance — and his drag — is that it doesn’t feel demeaning, like when college football players dress up as cheerleaders. All you get is a sense of pure, unbridled respect for a pop masterpiece, and a willingness to do the work necessary to pull it off. Try as they might, Mackie, LL Cool J, and Seth Rogen can’t do anything but acknowledge that he was a fucking beast — lipstick, ponytail, and all.</p><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-715fa246ad5b90090cecd80d43ea903e-11-0-0@published data-word-count=6><strong>Winner:</strong> Joseph Gordon-Levitt, by a ponytail.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-715fa246ad5b90090cecd80d43ea903e-12-0-0@published data-word-count=14><b>Overall winner:</b> Was there ever a question?
