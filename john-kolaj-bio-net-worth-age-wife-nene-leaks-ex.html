The former Real Housewives of Atlanta star had been dating Nyonisela, the businessman, since December 2021 following the passing of her husband, Gregg Leakes. <span>After being seen in several photos together around that time, Nene had eventually confirmed dating him, telling people that her late husband gave her his blessing to see other people before he died. More revelation: In an exclusive interview with Carlos King in July 2023, she</span> confirmed that she is still very much in contact with her ex, John Kolaj. So, it’s better that we tell you already who John is.</p><h3><strong>Meet John Kolaj, NeNe Leaks Ex</strong></h3><p>Going back over 10 years to The Real Housewives of Atlanta Season 4, Nene Leaks first met John Kolaj on screen. Viewers were told that the two crossed paths on&nbsp;The Celebrity Apprentice Season 11.</p><p>So, when in 2011, during RHOA season 4, Nene and John were “business partners”.</p><p>John at the time was the co-owner of Famous Famiglia Pizza. To viewers, the two looked like they were meeting about business, but John clearly seemed to want more from the relationship. So, during S04E20 of RHOA, John had surprisingly gifted Nene with a Rolex watch, which made for a memorable RHOA moment that went down in history. Their relationship, like that, had brought fans many memorable moments from the Bravo show.</p><p>Speaking of the present, in her prior mentioned interview, Nene said she talked to John “last night”. She added that he is doing good and that he called her about her son, Bryson “Bryce” Bryant. “He said I heard what happened to Bryce and I just want you to know that I will put him in a rehabilitation center in New York and I will pay for it”, this is also what Nene claims John told her. Further, she explained that she “could not” tell everything that John said on the phone. She actually also lightly admitted that she is thinking about going on a date with him. Not stopping there, she also confirmed about still owning that famous Rolex John bought her.</p><p>In the same interview, Nene also recalled that dating John was “like a fairytale”. Unapologetically, she also gushed how at the time there was “no limit” on spending and shopping sprees.</p><h3><strong>John Kolaj Wife</strong></h3><p>Unlike with Nene, we don’t know who John was married to or is still married to. There is no way for us to know who John’s wife was/is.</p><h3><strong>John Kolaj Age</strong></h3><p>John Kolaj was born in 1967. So, he reached the age of 56 in 2023.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is John Kolaj Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>John Kolaj is an American businessman. He reportedly had a net worth of $50 million as of 2023.</p><p>He actually comes from the family that founded the indeed very famous Famous Famiglia Pizza.</p><p>His bio on the Famous Famiglia website reads describes him as a Chief Operating Officer with more than thirty years of hands-on experience in the food service industry. In the company, John is responsible for managing the design, construction, and maintenance of all company and franchisee-owned operating units, designing the global infrastructure to support and maintain all procurement logistics and product distribution activities; and enabling and empowering his team of professionals to seamlessly manage training and support activities.</p><h3><strong>John Kolaj Family</strong></h3><p>John’s dad passed away in 1969 Italy when he was still very young. His younger brother, Giorgio Kolaj, the youngest of five children was just six months old when that happened.</p><p>Six months after this tragedy, their mother, Rosa Kolaj, AKA Mamma Rosa, arrived with them in the United States (New York City) in the spring of 1960. This was the family’s humble beginning of their journey toward the American Dream.</p><p>Though the early years were a struggle, John recalls even today how by “God’s grace”, she always had a way of turning the hardships into opportunities of instilling in her kids core values through the lessons of life. Through chores and responsibilities, John and his siblings learned the value of discipline, teamwork, and commitment. We began working early on in their youth, and through the years gained much experience in the pizza industry in New York City. And, by the summer of 1986, they opened their own pizzeria, Famous Famiglia, in the heart of New York City. In the years to follow, they opened several more pizzerias throughout New York City, winning awards for their quality and customer service standards.</p><p>John so you know has 3 brothers and a sister. Yet, unfortunately, one of them, brother Tony “Ndue” Kolaj is no more. He passed away on 16 January 2020 at the age of 58. He was a director of quality control at their Famous Famiglia and was living in White Plains.</p><p>The remaining Kolaj brother is Paul and he is the President and CEO at their pizza place.</p><h3><strong>John Kolaj Height</strong></h3><p>John Kolaj stands above 6 feet in height.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is John Kolaj Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>John Kolaj’s birthday is in April.
