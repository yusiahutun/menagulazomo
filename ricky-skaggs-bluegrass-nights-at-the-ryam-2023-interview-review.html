"My dad may have traded a pocketknife with him to get us backstage. I don't know. But he just said, 'Don't let that boy touch anybody's instruments.'"</p><p>Skaggs was standing against a wall playing his mandolin when Earl Scruggs came along and saw him, and the legendary musician told Skaggs' father to bring his son to audition for his television show, which helped launch his career. Skaggs would go on to play with Scruggs, Emmylou Harris and more before launching a hugely successful solo career in the 1980s. He returned to his roots in 1997 by releasing Bluegrass Rules! via Rounder Records, and in the years since, he's become the principal ambassador for bluegrass of his generation.</p><p>Skaggs says kids like his former self hold the key to the future of bluegrass, and live music in general.</p><p>"They're learning how to play their instruments," he says. "And God bless 'em ... I always tell moms and dads to bring their kids out to hear us play live music. It's impressive to go out and see live music, especially if you're young.</p><p>"It can really make a difference," he adds, citing the first time he, himself, saw Bill Monroe in person as a life-changing event.</p><p>Ricky Skaggs and Kentucky Thunder will return to the Ryman Auditorium on Dec. 10 for a <a href=#>special Christmas show</a> in 2023.
