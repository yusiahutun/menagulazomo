So when she first laid eyes on Peter Parker’s caretaker as she’s traditionally drawn—gray-haired, elderly, and possibly Victorian—she was a bit surprised. “It was a bit like, Has it come to this?!” Tomei, 52, told <i>InStyle </i>editor-in-chief Laura Brown.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But in the new film, Aunt May has been re-imagined as a younger, sexier, high-waisted-jeans-wearing cool aunt—a polarizing decision that, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>on Twitter</a>, has received outrage, applause, and its very own hashtag: #<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>SexyAuntMay</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It’s not the first age-defying role that Tomei has played. At 44, she famously appeared topless while portraying a stripper in <i>The Wrestler</i>, a performance that won her an Oscar. “I thought: Oh my god, what have I done? I’m naked, freezing my tatas off in some rank bar!” she said, laughing. “But afterwards, women would come up to me and say thank you...It seemed that women felt marginalized after a certain age and this made them feel visible and viable.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here, Tomei speaks with Brown about reinventing Aunt May, her oldest friends in the biz (she’s Zoe Kravitz’s godmother!) and her timeless beauty secrets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>Laura Brown: When you were cast in Spider-Man: Homecoming, people couldn't fathom Aunt May being portrayed as young and sexy. Why do you think fans latch onto a quality like age?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>Marisa Tomei: </b>They’re beloved characters. There’s an iconography to the actual drawings of the comics themselves, and it’s cozy. But their function is still the same. That’s what I tried to keep, and I think Marvel tried to keep. She’s still the home[maker], she still cares about him, and she’s really the person he’s most intimate with. All the essentials are still there.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>LB: How did the role come about? How do you metabolize a role that’s gone through so many different people and iterations?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>MT: </b>It all happened so fast, and within a week [of getting the offer], I was in the project. I discovered May is basically a Victorian character. She basically has a parasol, a high Victorian collar, a low bun, and I thought: She’s an eccentric, old broad. It was a bit like, 'Has it come to this?' And then I thought, 'You know what? I’m down with it!' But Marvel had a very clear vision that just worked, making everybody younger. We had a lot of conversations about what her contribution is to Peter Parker, where he gets his values from—and, of course, I was also very interested in the high-waisted pants.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>SONY PICTURES ENTERTAINMENT INC.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>LB: You said it was going to be Aunt May mixed with Tony Stark. What would you choose as Aunt May’s weapon—high-waisted pants?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>MT: </strong>I suppose so! I think there’s a place for her in <i>Ant Man</i>, I keep thinking also. I want the cross-pollination.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>LB: When have you felt the most physically confident—and the least?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>MT: </b>You know, I didn’t feel so great about my body until I met a friend of mine, while in my 20s, who had breasts around the same size as mine—we are on the smaller side. And I saw how she carried herself and how she felt beautiful and sexy. It kind of changed my whole thinking. It also still changes depending on your mental attitude, I think. I got really sick when we shot <i>Spider-Man</i>. I didn’t feel so great because I couldn’t really exercise, but it was fine ultimately.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>LB: You’ve said you feel more confident in your body as you’ve gotten older. True?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>MT:</b> I felt more confident being naked on screen as I got older, and I was glad I didn’t do it when I was younger. With the things that people say, it’s easier when you get older to go: That’s their projection, not me. It comes back to the word projection—what people want from me and trying to make everyone feel that.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>LB: What roles do people most commonly recognize you for?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>MT: </b>It’s a lot of, “My grandma loves you from <i>As the World Turns</i>,” which was my first job on a soap opera a long time ago. Then there’s a lot of high-fiving around [the <i>Cosby Show</i> spinoff] <i>A Different World</i>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>LB: Actual high-fiving?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>MT: </b>Yes! Then there’s the people that got married in Positano because of <i>Only You</i>, and they’re like, “We went to Amalfi because of that movie!” And there’s single ladies and the women of a certain age who are way into <i>The Wrestler </i>and feel very re-sexualized because of that film.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>LB: What was is about that movie that spoke to them?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>MT: </b>I was pretty surprised at myself, at the time. I thought: 'Oh my god, what have I done? This is the death knell for my career—I’m naked, freezing my tatas off in some rank bar in Newark.' Of course, it was with a master filmmaker, but it was scary. I went: 'Why did I decide to do this now?' I did think it could be seen as a desperate move. I was 44 when I did it, and I just thought it’s a little long in the tooth to be taking off all my clothes!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But the surprise was that afterwards, women would come up to me and say thank you. I thought: 'Why thank me? What did this mean to them?' Over a number of conversations, it seemed that women felt marginalized after a certain age, and this made them feel visible and viable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>LB: What reaction does <i>Cousin Vinny</i> get?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>MT: </b>Little girls do the foul-mouthed <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>killing of the deer speech</a>, and that’s absolutely adorable. People send their little 5-year-olds to recite it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>LB: You were cast as Gloria Steinem in the HBO miniseries about her life that’s in development. Are you still doing that?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>MT: </b>Yes—it’s been several iterations, and we’re going to bring it on home!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>LB: I think, in a way, she’s quite an every woman. She demonstrates that it’s alright to love clothes—that doesn’t undermine anything. You don’t have to have a manifesto every minute of the day.</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>MT: </b>She’s an enigma. It’s going to be a challenge playing her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>LB: Do you ever rely on your characters to help you play out real-life situations—like if you have to negotiate something or stand up for yourself?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>MT: </b>No, but I do think of other [real] people. The other day, I had to [come up with a difficult] answer, and for some reason I was like, what would <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Salma Hayek</a> do?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>LB: What would she do?!</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>MT: </b>I perceive her as being forthright but intelligent, with a great sense of humor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>LB: Who are your mates in the business, actors you’ve grown up with? How do you compare your experiences, 30 years into your careers?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>MT: </b>Lisa Bonet, her daughter Zoe Kravitz—she’s my goddaughter—Cree Summer, who was on [<i>A Different World</i>]. That was the original [crew] because that was my first, very visible job. The soap opera I was on, <i>As the World Turns,</i> I overlapped a little with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Julianne Moore</a>, so we go back a long way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>LB: How do you get over vanity on screen? Was there a moment in your career when you were like: 'Okay, I’m dropping my self-consciousness?'</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>MT: </b>When I’m dressed up and in character, I don’t feel it as acutely. It comes out more in photo shoots, actually. I don’t like getting my photo taken because it’s less of a character. And then on the set, you just hope that the lighting [is good]. It’s always good to snuggle up to the cinematographer and talk to the gaffer. You have to know your lighting set up—you try to learn that over the years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_74-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>LB: Your skin is so good. What do you do for it?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>MT: </b>I drink a lot of water. I’m an inside-out person. I think what you eat and how you take care of yourself [matters]. It took a long time for me to learn how to spend time [on that]. I’m also still a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Cetaphil</a> person, and there’s this organic line Persephone from LA whose moisturizer I use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>LB: And your hair—do you color it?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_80-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>MT: </b>Of course I color it! Who knows when I started? I was always dying my hair different colors. I liked that a lot. Now I’ve kind of settled into this warm, [brown shade].</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_82-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>LB: How did you celebrate your fiftieth birthday?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_84-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>MT:</b> I had a party in LA—a dance party! And also a big brunch. I'm glad I'm still dancing a lot.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_86-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>LB: Do you believe in dressing your age? How does your style change through different periods of your life?</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_88-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>MT: </b>I'm into more classic lines. And I’ve always been a vintage person, for sure. I still enjoy finding those treasures. I think less—I’m doing a lot of cleaning out of my closets over the past few years, which feels good.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_92-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>LB: Has your thinking about ambition changed in the last years? You could rest on your laurels and breathe if you wanted to.</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_94-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>MT: </strong>Ambition is a very interesting topic. The drive is still there. I still have lots of passion for what I do, and I want to keep doing it, and that requires putting some elbow grease into the business aspect of it. But I also find that lately, I feel like I can say: I am who I am. I’m more comfortable. I have so many interests, and making a mark is not really at the top of that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGedlr%2Bqv8Bmq6illZ56tLzInZyrZZ2Wu26t1KerZqWRrg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
