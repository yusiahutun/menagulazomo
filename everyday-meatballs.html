Smitten Kitchen is a sanctimony-free zone. I only mentioned this because when, as an adult, I began to consider the meatball as something apart from the flavor-anchors of spaghetti and a busy marinara sauce, I realized I wanted much more out of my meatballs. I wanted them to be good enough to fly solo as a dish, whether or not there was bread, or roasted potatoes, polenta or, yes, even spaghetti on the table. And I couldn’t stop fiddling with them.</p><p><a title="i love this design (and also the tomatoes)" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1494/25215390055_6d926c424a_z.jpg alt="i love this design (and also the tomatoes)" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="everyday meatballs" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1442/24588572343_8d48b7b0f5_z.jpg alt="everyday meatballs" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>For years, I fried meatballs before cooking them through because this was the Authentic way, even though I rather hated it because it’s such a splattering mess and you always lose a chunk here or there and the meatballs are far closer to meat blobs when you’re done (unless you’re willing to deep-fry them). Plus, it made them much more of a special occasion dish and I wanted ones we could eat any old day of the week. But when I dropped my meatballs uncooked into sauce, they’d fall apart. If I made them more firm, they wouldn’t fall apart but I didn’t like them as much. And so it went, back and forth; no meatballs went to waste as I puttered around with my recipe, but it was never quite right.</p><p><a title="everyday meatballs" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1513/25097123202_cd8e18fc6d_z.jpg alt="everyday meatballs" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Last month, I had a breakthrough which I realize will not sound like anything wild, but the simple act of more than doubling the amount of egg I usually put in made a meatball that stayed together even if not fried first but that was still tender and completely <a href=#>amazing</a> at the end. And now I can’t stop making them. You can serve them with anything that makes you happy — alone with a side of greens or salad, tossed with spaghetti but whatever you do, please do not do either of the following (unquestionably authentic) things: 1. Bake them “parmesan”-style the way you son likes from a local pizza place, i.e. with mozzarella and crunchy crumbs on top or 2. Find out what they taste like with a side of garlic bread or 3. Both, scooping one onto the other to form something of an open-faced meatball sub. Nothing good comes from knowing this combination exists. Trust me.</p><p><a title="everyday meatballs" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1543/24588568413_966bd6484b_z.jpg alt="everyday meatballs" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><b>One year ago:</b> <a href=#>Spaghetti Pangrattato with Crispy Eggs</a><br><b>Two years ago:</b> <a href=#>Dijon and Cognac Beef Stew</a><br><b>Three years ago:</b> <a href=#>Blood Orange Margaritas</a><br><b>Four years ago:</b> <a href=#>Double Coconut Muffins</a><br><b>Five years ago:</b> <a href=#>Spaghetti with Lemon and Olive Oil</a><br><b>Six years ago:</b> <a href=#>Monkey Bread with Cream Cheese Glaze</a>, <a href=#>Cauliflower and Caramelized Onion Tart</a><br><b>Seven years ago:</b> <a href=#>Devil’s Chicken Thighs and Braised Leeks</a><br><b>Eight years ago:</b> <a href=#>Pear and Almond Tart</a><br><b>Nine years ago:</b> <a href=#>Vegetable Dumplings</a></p><p><i>And for the other side of the world:</i><br><b>Six Months Ago:</b> <a href=#>Angel Hair Pasta with Raw Tomato Sauce</a><br><b>1.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Strawberries and Cream with Graham Crumbles</a><br><b>2.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Almond-Crisped Peaches</a><br><b>3.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Mediterranean Baked Feta with Tomatoes</a><br><b>4.5 Years Ago:</b> <a href=#>Hazelnut Plum Crumb Tart</a></p><p><b>Everyday Meatballs</b><br>Generously adapted over the years from <a href=#>Ina Garten</a> with some helpful tips from <a href=#>Luisa Weiss</a></p><p>Yield: 22 to 24 small (about 1.5-inch or 1.5 tablespoon) meatballs</p><p>1 pound ground meat (I use a mix of beef and pork)<br>2/3 cup fresh bread crumbs or 1/2 cup panko<br>1/3 cup milk or water<br>2 tablespoon finely chopped parsley<br>2 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan or Romano cheese (optional)<br>2 teaspoons coarse or kosher salt, divided<br>Pinches of red pepper flakes or few grinds of black pepper<br>1/2 teaspoon onion powder<br>2 large eggs<br>2 garlic cloves, minced, divided<br>2 tablespoons olive oil<br>1 28-ounce can of tomato puree or crushed tomatoes</p><p>Place meat, crumbs, milk or water, parsley, cheese (if using), 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, onion powder, eggs and half of your minced garlic in a large bowl. I like to mix all of this together with a fork, which does a good job of breaking up the eggs and chunks of meat. Form mixture into 1 1/2 to 2-inch meatballs and arrange on a plate. I like to let them set in the fridge for a bit — 30 minutes, if you can spare it — which helps them keep their shape.</p><p>In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Add remaining garlic and some pepper flakes and let sizzle until garlic is golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add tomatoes (beware the splatter!) and season with remaining salt. Let mixture simmer over low heat for about 10 minutes (with a thicker puree) or 20 (for crushed tomatoes, which are usually more watery), stirring occasionally.</p><p>With stove on the lowest heat possible to maintain a gentle simmer, add meatballs to sauce one by one, and cover with a lid. It will be hard but please don’t touch or move them for at least 20 minutes of the 25-minute cooking time, so that they have a chance to keep their shape. Meatballs should be fully cooked through at 25 minutes, but it cannot hurt to cut one in half to verify.</p><p>Eat however makes you happy:<br>— as-is.<br>— with spaghetti: I’ll cook it very al dente, a generous minute shy of done, reserve a little pasta water, then once the spaghetti is drained, place it back in the pot with a splash of the water and a ladle or two of the sauce beneath the meatballs and cook it together over high heat for a minute. Tip spaghetti into a large, wide bowl, add the meatballs on top. Note: If your family likes a lot of sauce with their spaghetti, you might consider making the meatballs with an extra half or whole can. Just use what you need.<br>— “parmesan”-ed: Place meatballs in a shallow baking dish with some of their sauce. Tear about 8 ounces mozzarella over the top and broil until melted. Finish with some parmesan, if desired, some breadcrumbs fried in a little olive oil and/or chopped parsley.<br>— with garlic bread (don’t do this, just don’t).
