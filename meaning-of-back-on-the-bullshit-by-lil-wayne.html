The song celebrates their resilience and determination to stay true to themselves despite any obstacles they may face.One standout lyric from the song is: "Big dually parked in my driveway, hanging out that motherfucker sideways." This lyric not only showcases their extravagant lifestyle but also represents their defiance and refusal to conform to societal norms. It highlights their rebellious nature and the idea that they will continue to live life on their own terms, regardless of what others think.Another important lyric in the song is: "I'm back up to full strength, pat-pat at the pulpit, gangster, amen." This lyric brings forward a theme of faith and self-confidence. It suggests that the artists have overcome challenges and are now stronger than ever. The reference to the pulpit and the use of the word "amen" adds a religious undertone, symbolizing their unwavering belief in themselves and their ability to persevere.Additionally, the lyric "All my niggas brainless, need brain donors" presents an interesting theme of loyalty and unity. It implies that the artists surround themselves with a tight-knit group who fully support and stand by them, even to the point of being willing to sacrifice for their shared cause. It suggests that their collective mindset is to stay true and loyal to one another, reinforcing the idea of brotherhood and solidarity.The line, "I shoot the driver in the head, make 'em honk the horn" introduces a theme of power and control. It portrays the artists as fearless and assertive, willing to take extreme measures to assert their authority. The act of shooting the driver and making them honk the horn can be seen as a metaphor for taking charge and leading the way, regardless of the consequences.Lastly, the chorus of the song, repeated multiple times throughout, emphasizes the overarching theme of being unapologetically true to oneself and not caring about others' opinions. The repetition of the line "You on that bullshit, ain't you?" serves as a reminder to both the artists and the listeners to stay focused on their own path, block out the noise, and continue to be themselves. It reinforces the idea that being on their "bullshit" is not a negative thing but a reflection of their authenticity and refusal to compromise.Overall, 'Back On the Bullshit' is a song that celebrates individuality, resilience, and a rebellious spirit. The various themes presented through different lyrics highlight the artists' determination to stay true to themselves, the power they possess, their unbreakable bonds, and their unwavering confidence in their abilities. It serves as a reminder to listeners to embrace their own uniqueness and not be swayed by external judgments or expectations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonyttctmrpqxnpp8rrHAp6Cnn12ks26uwJyiZqeeYsGpsYybrKWko522tXnBsmSloZxixKLFzZ4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
