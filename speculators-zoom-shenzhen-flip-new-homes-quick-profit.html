As many as 33,000 new homes were sold this year as of the end of October, according to Midland Realty’s research director Fion He, who expects the tally to rise by anther 27 per cent by the end of December to a five-year record of 42,000 homes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“People are just all bullish about Shenzhen’s future, and are ruling out any possibility of any drop in home prices because of [optimism] that government policies favour the city’s growth,” said He. “Getting a new home in Shenzhen means getting a cash cow.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Speculators are finding new tricks to skirt government controls to curb the enthusiasm. A booming business has been created where Shenzhen residents – limited to one per resident, or two per household – sell their unused home purchase quotas as surrogates for as much as 300,000 yuan to property buyers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Using someone else’s quota to buy a home is very risky, as the property will be registered in someone else’s name,” said Dentons’ real estate lawyer Liu Ziru in Shenzhen. “We will see [legal] disputes when these surrogate real estate are put on the market in the next few years.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shenzhen authorities are poised to rein in the buying binge created by the price arbitrage and the profligacy of surrogates, with the local housing and construction department saying on November 30 that it is “actively discussing comprehensive policies regarding the recent new home frenzy … to make the market more rational and develop in a stable way”, without giving details.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To be sure, it is not the government’s first attempt at damping a property bubble. Non-residents of the city were slapped with increasing restrictions in 2016 such as tax and social security requirements to entitle them to buy property.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2018, companies were banned from buying homes, while residential property had to be held for three years before reselling. Most recently in July, the government posted additional residency and tax requirements for buying homes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><span class="c1 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" id=U203064550945M2F data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0>“Shrugging aside the risks, the only way to solve the housing problem is to increase the supply of homes,” said Liu. “In a city like Shenzhen where people continue to flow in, and more homes are needed every year, price cap or tightening of purchase entitlements may not be the correct way to curb the prices, or go far enough.”</span></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Speculators flip Shenzhen homes for a quick profit</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtfmLWqusBmma6rmaOytL%2BOmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkGppaWxmZMCxscKuo5qsn6fAbsbOqKRmq5iau7u0xKdkn6SZpXqvsdZmn6illah6ssHInKJmqKKks6rA</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
