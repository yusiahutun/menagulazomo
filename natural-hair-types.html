Or maybe you didn't realize that your specific natural hair type needs more moisture, more frequent washing, or less protein-based treatments while all of the above worked for someone else.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though sometimes controversial, the natural hair type chart is one of the first tools naturalistas use to begin to understand their hair and how to best care for it. The alphanumeric chart lists hair types based on texture, from numbers 1 to 4, with subcategories of A, B, and C — meaning someone can be a 2B while another is a 4C. 1 is the straightest category, with texture increasing all the way to 4, which is the kinkiest curl.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">No matter your hair type (they're all beautiful!), you'll want to know how to take care of your strands. That's why InStyle spoke with celebrity hairstylists <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Lacy Redway</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Ursula Stephen</a> to find out what you need to know about your unique strands.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-type-1></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Type 1</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Julian Birchman/InStyle.com</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Type 1 ranges from 1A (bone straight) to 1C (straight with a slight wave) and is notorious for not requiring heavy product. Stephen, who has worked with A-listers like Rihanna, Zendaya, Laverne Cox, and more, recommends lighter product usage for those with type 1 hair. "Finer hair doesn't require as much moisture," she tells us. "I suggest washing your hair with Dove's Clarify & Hydrate Shampoo and Conditioner, as its charcoal-infused formula efficiently removes product build-up without stripping hair, leaving it hydrated and soft."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Redway, who works with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Nexxus</a> as a style and trends curator, agrees. "If you have type 1 hair, but it's also super fine, you want to stay away from products that will weigh it down," she shares. "You also really want to follow the suggestion of putting conditioner on from mid-shaft to ends instead of getting it on your scalp. This may weigh your strands down and make your hair look greasy fresh out of wash day."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-type-2></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Type 2</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Julian Birchman/InStyle.com</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Type 2 hair ranges from a beachy wave to loose curls and tends to hold a curl longer than type 1 hair. For Redway, a salt spray or leave-in conditioner and bun gives you all the style options you need with this hair type. "I love to use salt spray like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Ouai Wave Spray</a> on this hair type as a styler to really give that beachy wave effect," the stylist explains. "I use a leave-in conditioner like Amika The Wizard Detangling Primer on damp hair and twirl the hair into a bun. Once the bun is let down, you will have some gorgeous waves to change up your look or keep your strands tamed."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, if this is your first rodeo with a leave-in, Redway offers some wise shopping advice. "I always recommend buying a smaller quantity, almost like a sampler or travel size of a product, to try it first," she suggests. "This way, you're able to discover if it's the right product for your hair type or not."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-type-3></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Type 3</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Julian Birchman/InStyle.com</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Type 3 hair brings us fully into the land of the curl, ranging from looser to tighter ringlets. That said, the most important tip for type 3s to remember is moisture, moisture, moisture.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"For curly hair, I recommend staying away from products that will dry out your hair — anything with a lot of alcohol in it," says Stephen. "Instead, opt for moisturizing products such as gels, mousses, and curl creams. I recommend using Dove's Amplified Textures Detangling Conditioner. This coconut milk-infused conditioner adds moisture to your curls and provides maximum slip to comb through your hair with great ease, resulting in ready-to-style hair."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stephen is also a fan of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>co-washing</a> for type 3's, which is a method of simply washing your hair with conditioner instead of shampoo. "This often leaves hair smoother, softer, and easier to manage."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-type-4></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Type 4</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Julian Birchman/InStyle.com</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Type 4 hair ranges from a tight ringlet to a kinky, coily texture — but this type requires some specific care. "Type 4 curls tend to be drier than most hair types, so I always recommend keeping your type 4 strands really moisturized and hydrated," Redway advises. "The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Nexxus Keraphix Damage Healing Masque</a> is such an inexpensive splurge because of the retail price, and it adds proteins back into your hair strands. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Creme of Nature's Moisturizing Milk Masque Repairing Treatment</a> is also good to help repair dryness or heat damage."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Redway also offers another luxurious care tip for anyone with type 4 hair: steaming. "Giving your hair a good steam will allow the cuticles to open up and help the product penetrate," she says. "The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Q-Redew Hair Steamer</a> is a great steamer designed to help enhance curls and coils while also detangling your strands."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On top of treatments, creating a washing schedule is also important for this hair type. "I recommend washing it once a week rather than daily to ensure your hair is moisturized, clean, and healthy," Stephen says. "Wash your hair with Dove's Amplified Textures Hydrating Cleanse Shampoo. Its sulfate-free formula removes build-up while restoring shine, moisture, and volume to your curls." For type 4s, Stephen is also a fan of washday styles that lock in moisture. "I suggest opting to do twist-outs, and double-strand twists as a form of protective styling, using Dove's Amplified Textures Twist in Moisture Shaping Butter Cream."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>All Natural</a>.
