We think it would be a massive collaboration," Hubbard says in the video below, adding, "We'd love to send it to you. We don't have your email or your phone number, so we're gonna just play a little."</p><p>With that, they cue the song up. The lush, mid-tempo track appears to be titled "Feels Good," and true to that title, it's a feel-good love song that would lend itself very readily to Underwood's voice joining in on the FGL harmonies that are already present.</p><p>Of course, FGL are no strangers to hit collaborations in multiple genres. Among their biggest hits are collaborations with Nelly on "Cruise," <a href=#>Tim McGraw</a> on "May We All," <a href=#>Luke Bryan</a> on "This Is How We Roll," the Backstreet Boys on "God, Your Mama, and Me," Bebe Rexha on "Meant to Be" and more.</p><p>Underwood has not yet publicly responded to Florida Georgia Line's song pitch.</p><p><strong>Do You Know&nbsp;the Secret History of Carrie Underwood's "Before He Cheats"?</strong></p><p><strong>See Inside Brian Kelley's Spectacular Country Estate</strong></p><p><strong>See Inside Carrie Underwood's Nashville Mansion:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmn6Sfp7alrYygnKiql56ubrjIp5xmm5Gnv6qxjK6lnZ2irLywsIycpqWkkZe8s63ToqanZaCewaS0jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
