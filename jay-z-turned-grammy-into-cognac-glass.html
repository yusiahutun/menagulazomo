And obviously, it’s subjective. Obviously, it’s subjective, because, you know, it’s music and it’s opinion-based. But, you know, some things …”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He then gestured toward Beyoncé and continued: “I don’t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone, and never won Album of the Year. So even by your own metrics, that doesn’t work. Think about that: The most Grammys, never won Album of the Year—that doesn’t work.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Some of you are gonna go home tonight and feel like you’ve been robbed,” he added. “Some of you may get robbed. Some of you don’t belong in the category. No, when I get nervous, I tell the truth.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I mean, someone has to be real about this whole thing. Anyway, Jay ended his speech with an encouraging message to the audience: “Forget the Grammys, you got to keep showing up. Until they give you all those accolades you feel you deserve. Until they call you ‘chairman,’ until they call you a ‘genius,’ until they call you ‘the greatest of all time.’ You feel me? Thank you.”</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/281ca4da-3e06-4994-8c0d-6abe79956de7_1539814210.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Mehera Bonner" title="Headshot of Mehera Bonner" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Mehera Bonner is a celebrity and entertainment news writer who enjoys Bravo and Antiques Roadshow with equal enthusiasm, She was previously entertainment editor at Marie Claire and has covered pop culture for over a decade.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6GutbHSrWaabGZrgXiBj2xmo5mpYsduwNSrpZ6cXZy%2FornMsmSipqSkeqS7xqeYnGWXoa60v44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
