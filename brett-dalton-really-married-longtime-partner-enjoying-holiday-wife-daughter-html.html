We have never done the baby voice. We have never said no without an explanation. We try and explain things to her. We try to have patience and sympathy for where she is at in her process of this crazy world that we brought her into. So we just try and talk to her like a human being.</p><p>Obviously every parent thinks that they have the smartest and most beautiful child in the world. We have got some crazy compliments from a lot of people. She definitely seems to have an old soul. I think the funniest comment I ever got was ‘I was going to have a baby, but why? I give up. There will never be a baby better than this.’ So we are like okay we will take that.</p><p>We really try and explain things to her. We are very patient with her. We also have been very lucky as well. She didn’t have colic or anything like that. It kind of felt like she was meant to be in this world. She didn’t even cry when she was born. She had this look on her face like oh this is what I imagined the world to be like. This is cool.</p><p>Brett Dalton first welcomed his daughter named Sylvia Dalton in 2012 along with his wife and took to Instagram to share his happy news of daughter's birth.

He stated,</p><p>&nbsp;I have had countless moments. The one I first remember was dancing with my daughter. She was about four months old. She could smile at that point. I think she was laughing a little bit too. I just remember thinking I will be doing this at her wedding. There is something so special about father daughter time. We have all these cool adventure that we go on now, but I remember at that point that this was one of the best moments in the world. We were in our own little world. I was thinking what has happened to me. I am dancing and crying with a small child in my living room. I just have no explanation for it. I remember thinking that no matter what happens I hope that we can always come back and dance together.</p><p>Also, he was asked whether he had the particular father-daughter ritual/act between him and his daughter that everyone enacts to make their daughter. He replied,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"We have had this thing forever actually. I will pretend to chase her and scrunch up my shoulders and do a standing crab type of walk. It is really ridiculous, but I go around chasing her. I would say, ‘I’m gonna get cha. I’m gonna get cha.’ She will always laugh at that."</p><p><img alt height=371 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com/uploads/celebrity/Brett%20Dalton's%20Daughter%20(FILEminimizer).JPG" width=600 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Brett shared the latest <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweet </a>talking about his daughter, Sylvia on 21 January 2018.&nbsp;</p><h2>Married To His Longtime Girlfriend:</h2><p>Brett Dalton, who stands at the height of&nbsp;6’2” (1.88m) shares his five years old daughter with his wife, Melissa Trn.
