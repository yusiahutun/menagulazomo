The Oscar winner, 48, played Jordan Catalano on the series, and fans definitely noticed his absence. In fact, a number of fans took to the comments of the tweet, sharing how excited they were to see the cast reunited, but also noting how predictable it was for Jared to not make an appearance. “Beautiful! And classic Jordan Catalano move to skip the reunion,” one fan tweeted. Another fan asked, “Where is Jordan Catalon?” To which one Twitter user threw some shade at Jared, saying he was off “running his cult.” Yikes!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Before Jared was a bonafide Oscar winner who recently made news for<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> traversing the desert</a> and missing the global news on the COVID-19 outbreak, he starred as Jordan Catalano alongside Claire Danes’ Angela Chase.&nbsp;My So-Called Life debuted on August 25, 1994. The series, which only saw one season, ran for 19 episodes and chronicled the complicated high school life of the mid-90s through the eyes of Angela. Jordan was the main love interest of Angela, who tried to help him through his learning disabilities. The pair had a dramatic relationship that played out on the show, which saw the two finally get together in the series finale.

Both she and Jared have seen a lot of success since their time on the show. Claire has won four Golden Globes&nbsp;and earned three Emmy awards for her work on the series&nbsp;Homeland. Jared went on to win an Oscar for his work in the 2013 film Dallas Buyers Club opposite <strong>Matthew McConaughey</strong>.
