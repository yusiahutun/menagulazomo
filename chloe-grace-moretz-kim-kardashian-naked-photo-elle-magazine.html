"@KimKardashian I truly hope you realize how important setting goals are for young women, teaching them we have so much more to offer than just our bodies," she commented on Kim's pic.</p><p>After getting some flack for "slut-shaming," the young actress clarified her statement, saying, "There's a huge difference in respecting the platform that you're given as a celebrity and 'slut shaming' something I never have done and would never do."</p><p>Kim quickly clapped back, writing, "Let's all welcome @ChloeGMoretz to twitter, since no one knows who she is. your nylon cover is cute boo."</p><p>Now that the Twitter feud has died down, Moretz has continued to defend her statements.</p><p>"All I'll say is that I think a lot of things can be misconstrued in a lot of ways," she tells <strong><a href=#>Elle</a></strong> magazine. "And I think if people open their minds more, and they try to look deeper into something than just something that is a very big, hot, fiery button to hide behind...I think if people looked into something bigger that I was trying to speak upon, they wouldn't be so easy to fire back silly, miscellaneous things."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>The 19-year-old star also explains that she likes to stay true to herself in her social media posts. She insists that you will never see her "playing a character" like you might see in a magazine photo shoot.</p><p>"I think that's also a lot more based on artwork, so that's a little bit of a different conversation. Like, if I'm talking to a photographer, I'm talking to a stylist, I'm talking to a makeup artist, we're kind of creating and collaborating and making something that is artwork and is special and is different. Yeah, it's representing myself, but it's also not representing myself, because it's a character piece. So, I think that is a big difference," she declares. "On social media, like on Instagram and stuff that I post, and the way that I view myself, and portray myself on there, that's definitely a much more personalized take. I'm not collaborating with people to make that, it's my own social media platform in which I'm–it's not a character, it's just me."</p><p>The actress has grown up in the spotlight, which has helped her navigate the pitfalls of social media.</p><p>"Depict yourself adequately as what you want to be seen as," she suggests, when asked about advice for her young fans. "Don't front, don't put something out there that you feel isn't realistic and doesn't portray who you are. Just be yourself, be you, and don't be afraid to speak your mind."</p><p>Whose side are you on?
