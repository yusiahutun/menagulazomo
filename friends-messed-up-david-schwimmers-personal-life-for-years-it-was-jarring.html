How do I do my job? So that was tricky.”</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> continued: “I didn’t feel like my character had changed, but suddenly people were treating me in a very, very different way, that sometimes was flattering, but mostly very evasive.”</p><p>Unlike his fellow Friends stars, who went on to star in countless projects, David chose to tackle roles behind the camera and theater. He went on to become a director and starred on Broadway and the West End. Who could forget he is the voice of Melman the giraffe in the Madagascar franchise?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-109937994-1024x736.jpg><p>Schwimmer wasn’t the only star on set who struggled with the sudden rise to fame. <a href=#>Matthew Perry</a>, who tragically died on Saturday (October 28, 2023) also found the unexpected popularity difficult to handle.</p><p>However, his drug and alcohol use became a major obstacle for the sitcom star. So much so that the 54-year-old said he’d trade his fame and fortune to avoid addiction.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-david-schwimmer-married-ex-wife-zoe-buckman-in-2010>David Schwimmer married ex-wife Zoe Buckman in 2010</h2><p>Although David and <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> admitted to having crushes on each other during the early days of Friends, the co-stars never dated. The actor was in a relationship with Australian singer Natalie Imbruglia in the late 1990s, before marrying British artist Zoe Buckman in 2010 after a three-year romance.</p><p>Their daughter, Cleo Buckman Schwimmer was born May 8, 2011.</p><p>David and Zoe confirmed their split in a joint statement in April 2017: “Our priority is, of course, our daughter’s happiness and well-being during this challenging time,” they announced.</p><p><strong>If you’ve been affected by this story, you can contact American Addiction Centers on (877) 686-7688 or Talk To Frank on 0300 123 6600 in the UK.</strong></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2V%2FcLLRopynnKNiuqa%2F0p6bZq2gYrGiwsidZKybmKy2rrnEq6pmqJWnwLC6wKVkpaGWmnqnu9FmsJ6Zoqh6qsCMsJisZZqWv7O1zaBm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
