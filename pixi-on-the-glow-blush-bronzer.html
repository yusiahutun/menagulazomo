I found out about Pixi’s blush and bronzer sticks like how most people in 2023 find out about things: TikTok. Brainlessly scrolling through my feed in bed, there was one video that stopped me dead in my tracks: A young woman demonstrated how she was applying bronzer and then blush in just a few swipes."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Brainlessly scrolling through my feed in bed, there was one video that stopped me dead in my tracks: A young woman demonstrated how she was <a href=#>applying bronzer</a> and then blush in just a few swipes.

Her complexion looked like she had just returned from a tropical <a href=#>vacation</a>: it was glowy, and perfectly flushed, and I wanted it.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>All you need for the two-step process is <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Pixi on the Glow Bronze Tinted Moisturizer Stick</a> ($18) and <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Pixi on the Glow Blush</a> ($18). Both have identical stick applicators with a variety of tones and shades, so you can mix and match based on your skin tone and complexion. Staring at my nutrient- and outdoor-deficient skin, I chose the second-lightest bronzer in “Rich Glow” and the “Juicy” blush, which is a pretty coral.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pixi-bronzer-2.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pixi-blush.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=first-let-s-talk-about-the-bronze-tinted-moisturizer-stick><strong>First, let’s talk about the Bronze Tinted Moisturizer Stick</strong></h2><p>As someone who’s been skittish about bronzer and the whole contouring situation her whole life, I can confirm this is an amazing bronzer for newbies. Since it’s a bronzer moisturizing stick, it’s more like a semi-sheer balm—the formula gives you just enough pigment to make your angles (i.e. cheekbones, jawline, bridge of your nose) pop and cheeks light up without looking cartoonish. I’ve even tested “Beach Glow,” which is the darkest shade, and I was able to blend it in without feeling like a makeup fail. It’s really buildable, so this stick has tons of range.</p><p>With cooler and drier weather on the horizon (how is it almost October?), I love that this bronzer adds hydration to my complexion—unlike powder formulas that are better suited for humid summer days. Packed with antioxidants and vitamins, the formula is like a glass of water for skin—it makes it feel plumper and more supple after application. Another nice thing? It’s not greasy, so if you have naturally oily skin, you won’t feel like you need to immediately use a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Clean & Clear Oil Absorbing Sheet</a> (aka, my BFF in 8th grade).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>See below how it looks:</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/before-after-pixi-blush-bronzer.jpeg><p>See? Super natural. Subtle. But I can build more pigment if I want. It looks like I’m not even wearing anything, which is what I’m going for. For a look that’s a bit more dramatic, check out this TikTok:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-on-the-glow-blush-in-real-life><strong>The On-the-Glow Blush in real life</strong></h2><p>After I apply bronzer, I’ll add a few swipes of the On-the-Glow Blush just like I saw on TikTok, and it actually looks perfect? I’ve probably tried several hundreds of blushes in my lifetime as a shopping editor, and this is definitely in my top 5 along with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Nars Orgasm</a>. Like the bronzer, it’s this ultra-hydrating balm that gives you a luminous, sheer-but-buildable swipe of pigment, like someone just pinched your cheeks.&nbsp;</p><p>And like the bronzer, it’s a nice addition to your fall and winter beauty arsenal, since it only adds moisture to your skin. I’ve been using this combination every day since TikTok discovered it for me, but I’ll most certainly be using it during the dry seasons so I can fake direct sunlight exposure and capture that ~lit from within~ glow.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here’s what “Juicy” looks like with the bronzer:</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bronzer-and-blush-rotated.jpg><p>But—and you know there’s always a but. It’s selling fast. The blush has sold out several times ever since Gen Z caught whiff of Pixi by Petra, and the bronzer is well on its way to out-of-stock land. And just an FYI, Amazon has a ton of Pixi knockoff brands, and they aren’t the same thing (beware!), so you actually have to order it from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Target </a>(shipping is free if you have a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Red Card</a>—which you should have anyway for the 5 percent cashback—or if you spend $35, so you’re covered if you get both).&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1mmpqqlWR%2Bd4CQcmlxZ6Cexap5zqdkraCVYrStu9ZmmaWto516o77Op7Geql8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
