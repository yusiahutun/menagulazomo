He shifted his base to California in 1947 to pursue his true love- acting. In 1948, he debuted in ‘City Across the River’. Turkel was married to Anita J Turkel with whom he had two sons. Very little information is available on his wife. His wife’s life was largely kept private. All we know is that she preceded the actor in his death.<br>&nbsp;<br>Turkel had more than 140 acting credits to his name. He teamed up with iconic director Stanley Kubrick on three movies namely ‘The Killing’, ‘Paths of Glory’, and ‘The Shining’. Turkel's role as Lloyd in 'The Shining' has been spoofed and homaged in TV and film over the years, including 2016's Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence sci-fi flick 'Passengers', which found Michael Sheen playing a similarly dressed, similarly unflappable bartender named Arthur. He later played replicant creator Eldon Tyrell in1982’s ‘Blade Runner’. In his 40-year career, Turkel appeared in movies such as ‘The St. Valentine’s Day’, ‘The Sand Pebbles’ and ‘King Rat’ among others. The actor had completed a memoir, titled ‘The Misery of Success’ before his death. His family plans to publish it later this year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/e769aacf-ae2a-4be2-943d-2f9ae3ac1721.PNG><h2 class=split>‘What a gifted fellow he was’</h2><p>Tributes poured in for the actor as one of the users stated, “Oh my goodness, anyone on here will know that Blade Runner is my favorite film. Joe Turkel was immense in it. RIP.” Another stated, “He seemed like the nicest guy in interviews, wish I had the chance to speak with him at a convention or just shake his hand. RIP to a legend.” One user posted, “So perfect in his two most iconic rolls. Both Bladerunner and Shining almost unimaginable without him.”<br>&nbsp;<br>The next one tweeted, “From what I read about Joe Turkel, he was a gentleman. At a special Blade Runner screening many years after it’s first debuted, he greeted every audience member at the end of the film as they exited the theater. Rest In Peace.” One added, “RIP JOE TURKEL: Crushed to learn of the death of Joe Turkel. His film credits included Eldon Tyrell in Blade Runner and Lloyd the Bartender in The Shining. We became friends when I hired him to voice the Special X channel in the early @SiriusXM days. What a gifted fellow he was.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/9d81df66-9a3a-487c-ba9e-1377e43326c6.PNG><p dir=ltr lang=en>Oh my goodness, anyone on here will know that Blade Runner is my favourite film.
