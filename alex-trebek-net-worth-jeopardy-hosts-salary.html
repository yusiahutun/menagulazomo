As Deadline reported, Alex makes about $391,000 for each taping day, while bringing home around $78,000 per actual episode.

Since he <a href=#>revealed he’s been diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer</a>&nbsp;in March 2019, Alex has been <a href=#>extremely open with his adoring fans</a> regarding his health battle.</p><p>“Now, I’d be lying if I said the journey was an easy one,” he confessed during a previous episode of the show. “There were some good days, but a lot of not so good days.”</p><p>Despite the fact that Alex previously mentioned <a href=#>his health was improving</a> amid his battle with cancer, the TV personality revealed in late September that <a href=#>doctors were putting him back on chemotherapy</a>. His physicians hoped Alex would respond well to immunotherapy but were faced with the stark reality of this terrible disease when his numbers went “much higher than they were when” he was first diagnosed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-net-worth03.jpg><p>“I was doing so well. And my numbers went down to the equivalent of a normal human being who does not have pancreatic cancer. So we were all very optimistic,” he candidly shared during an interview on <a href=#>Good Morning America</a>, adding doctors knew something was wrong when he dropped 12 pounds in one week. “And my numbers went sky high. So, the doctors have decided that I have to undergo chemo again and that’s what I’m doing.”</p><p>Fans are hoping Alex will overcome his battle with cancer considering he’s insisted many times he has no interest in retiring. While chatting with&nbsp;Closer Weekly&nbsp;in a previous interview, the former&nbsp;The Wizard of Odds&nbsp;host — who has been receiving <a href=#>endless support from wife <strong>Jean Currivan Trebek</strong></a> on his road to recovery — gushed about his longtime gig.</p><p>“I’ll keep hosting as long as my skills haven’t diminished and I still enjoy it. The thought of retiring occurs to me every so often, but so far I am still enjoying it,” he <a href=#>exclusively told Closer</a>. “Over 50 years ago, I hosted a local quiz show in Toronto called Reach for the Top, and now I am hosting one of the biggest game shows in television history. There isn’t anything out there that I would trade for this job.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46ao56wXam%2Fpq7EpGSnnaRixLC%2B06Fko52fpa6zsNhmn6irpKh6tK3LmqmyZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
