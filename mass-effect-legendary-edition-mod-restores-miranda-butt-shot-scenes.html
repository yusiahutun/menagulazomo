As reported byGame Informer, it was brought to our attention that a modder has taken the time to restore the Miranda butt shots that were cut from the release of the Legendary Edition.
Miranda Lawson is a fan-favourite character that was introduced in Mass Effect 2. To say that Miranda was a popular romance choice in Mass Effect is an understatement."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

To say that Miranda was a popular romance choice in Mass Effect is an understatement. Though, she wasn’t the easiest character to romance (not that I would know, obviously).</p><p>Almost every time Miranda graced us with her presence on the screen, we were greeted with a camera angle not often used when interacting with other characters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/storage.googleapis.com/gamebyte/2021/02/L_4SRYgQ-e1612439331776-700x381.jpeg><h2>Butt why?</h2><p>The removal of Miranda’s butt shots from Mass Effect Legendary Edition caused some outrage for a section of the gaming community and as Liana Ruppert of Game Informer perfectly puts it caused “Miranda Buttgate 2021”.</p><p>To be fair, there were a variety of odd camera angles in the OG Mass Effect Trilogy with several of its characters. But perhaps Miranda’s was the most memorable (for some reason).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/bQwhCC13rWI/hqdefault.jpg><p>So, in the Legendary Edition, BioWare took the opportunity to fix many of the odd camera angles, which included those belonging to Miranda. Henceforth “Miranda Buttgate 2021”.</p><p>Thankfully, for those of you that want to see the return of the opportunistic camera angles, you can download the PC mod that restores Miranda’s butt shots<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> via Nexus mods</a>. The mod will restore all your favourite camera angles in both Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/storage.googleapis.com/gamebyte/2021/07/e4c24a3a-mass-effect-miranda-butt-shot-2.jpg><h2>The butt is back!</h2><p>The mod’s author ‘linkenski‘ says: “Steel your eyes, and pinch your nose! Now you can enjoy the sight of this woman’s backside as she talks about extremely sad and serious things, just like you used to. *Brrrrrap, brap*”</p><p>Apparently, there is a surprise when the mod is installed. All I know is that the volume needs to be up.</p><p>Will you be downloading the Miranda Butt Shot mod? Let us know across our social media channels.
