"He had a big entourage. I was just this kind of model."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She went on to reveal that during the shoot, she felt objectified. "Yeah, completely," she said when Laverne asked about the mood on set. "And vulnerable and scared."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Moss went on to say that the Calvin Klein team loved that she wasn't at ease, adding that "they played on my vulnerability," and that she looked "young" and "innocent" next to Wahlberg. It was something that "Calvin loved," Moss said of the designer. Not only would the ads run on billboards and in magazines, there was video that eventually made its way into TV commercials.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Moss even shared that while prepping for the big day, she felt uneasy and nervous.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I really didn't feel well at all before the shoot," she said. "For like, a week or two, I couldn't get out of bed."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eventually, Moss would have a long relationship with Klein and his namesake brand, appearing in multiple campaigns for underwear, fragrance, and ready-to-wear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>Entertainment Tonight</a> notes that Moss has been frank about the experience in the past. Back in 2012, Moss shared a similar story with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=noopener>Vanity Fair</a>, saying she "had a nervous breakdown when I was 17 or 18, when I had to go and work with Marky Mark and [photographer] Herb Ritts."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8qaq55lnaTAtHnBm5pmqpGZtrB5zJqppGWnlrWtrsSrnmabkaHDqrqMpKOeoZ5iwq%2BwxKuunpmiYrCiuc%2BaoKCmXZa7ubXErbA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
