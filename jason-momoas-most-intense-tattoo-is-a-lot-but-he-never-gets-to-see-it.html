Jason Momoa portrays the heavily tatted King Of Atlantis, Aquaman, but his real body art isn’t as gnarly as on-screen.

That’s not the say the actor, 44, doesn’t love to sit in a chair for hours on end for a permanent image on his skin. One particular tattoo, however, “felt like death” for the action star. Worst part? He can never see it directly with his own eyes.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1866344331-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jason-momoa-met-his-ancestors-through-painful-head-tattoo>Jason Momoa ‘met his ancestors’ through painful head tattoo</h2><p>Momoa’s first tattoo is a half sleeve on his left forearm, depicting aumakua, a family god guardian that can be represented by different animals. In Jason’s case, the tattoo features triangle shark teeth.</p><p>A similar pattern was designed on his head in September 2022, but it is only visible when his hair is shaved. Even the man himself is taken aback every time he spots it in photos.</p><p>“It’s always funny when I see it,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> GQ. “I’m like, ‘Woah, it’s so…a lot. But I don’t ever see it and I look in the mirror, I’m like, ‘I can’t see it.'”</p><p>“It always looks pretty intense,” he admitted.</p><p>Momoa’s proudness of his Hawaiian culture is evident through his traditional tattoo process. His head design was created by the ancient method of hand-tapping, which sees a Hawaiian tattoo master use a pencil-sized wooden tool to hammer an ink-dipped bone into the flesh, leaving behind the patterned ink stain. Grueling sessions can last from three to five hours.</p><p>Hand-tapping requires two hands to execute and others must be present to stretch the skin. Momoa’s head tattoo was created by Keone Nunes, who is credited for the revival of traditional tattooing in the 1990s.</p><p>“It was really beautiful and purifying. And I’ve never had that kind of pain before. You get to meet your ancestors for sure,” he said while pointing to his scalp.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jason-momoa-bares-his-bum-to-show-off-leg-tattoo>Jason Momoa bares his bum to show off leg tattoo</h2><p>Fans saw more than expected during Jason’s appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live in November 2022 – and they’re weren’t mad about it. The Game Of Thrones actor stripped down to his traditional Hawaiian Malo, a loincloth worn by men that covers only their crown jewels.</p><p>Momoa twirled for the audience, showing off his bum and the large geometric tattoo that runs from his left thigh down to his calf.</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2aDcLbArKanZZ2kurCt0makqKukYravwMSnqp5lpJbBtbvOZqCsZZFiubDAjJusrWWYmnqvsdWeqWaflanAbsDOZqqenV2ewXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
