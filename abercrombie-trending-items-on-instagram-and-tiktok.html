Most recently, I can't seem to escape the <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Sloane Tailored Trousers</a></span>, with reviews claiming they're the perfect wide-leg style, so I had to find out for myself.&nbsp;</p><a href=# class=buttonWidgetButtonLink_b94rpwz rel="sponsored nofollow"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ac3eb76a75b6-sloane-pants.png></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£65 at Abercrombie & Fitch</p></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>$90 at Abercrombie & Fitch US</p></a><p id=e3DaOudULQ data-wc=41>I headed into the new store on Carnaby Street in London, and my totally honest mini review? It's small and stock is seriously limited. So if you're nowhere near the capital, no problem, ordering online is probably your best bet anyway.</p><p id=e6fvw30vTv data-wc=54>They did, however, stock the Sloane trousers and they were everything I was hoping for. High-waisted with a partially elasticated waistband, they're both flattering and seriously comfortable. I'd say the tailored pair fall between a wide and a straight-leg cut - chic and versatile. They also have press creases which make them look expensive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0426cd192ae2-abercrombie-sloane.jpg><p id=e4hML1paRE data-wc=37>Available in waist sizes 24-37 inches and extra short to long lengths, I'd say they run true to size, although a little on the shorter side. For reference, I'm 5'6 and the long was perfect for me.&nbsp;</p><p id=elkO-ljwwm data-wc=51>They retail for £65, which is by no means cheap, but taking cost per wear into consideration, I think they're quite affordable. I styled them with a classic white tee and trainers, but would also wear them with loafers, crop tops, shirts, knitwear and blazers - basically everything in my wardrobe.&nbsp;</p><p id=eLdmhh5Jkn data-wc=57>Abercrombie's leather trousers have also been on my wishlist for a long time so I was very excited to see them in stock, and I was so impressed. I've tried countless styles from other brands and always found them a bit unflattering, but the <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Vegan Leather High Rise Loose Pants</a></span> come in the perfect high-waisted, thigh-skimming cut.</p><a href=# class=buttonWidgetButtonLink_b94rpwz rel="sponsored nofollow"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/506b1ecc9255-leather-trousers.jpg></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£82 at Abercrombie & Fitch</p></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>$110 at Abercrombie & Fitch US</p></a><p id=e9MC_Po4lN data-wc=40>Again, I'd consider them closer to straight-leg than loose. The best bit? They're incredibly soft and comfortable. They didn't have the long in stock, but I quite liked the cropped finish of the regular with a pair of heeled boots.</p><p id=eHpXY12vOy data-wc=74>Also on my shopping list was a staple black mini skirt that I can wear all-year round. The mini skirt has made a massive comeback in recent seasons and I love styling them with an oversized blazer and a pair of loafers, but it's hard to find the right cut in a material that doesn't instantly crease. I recently saw <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Kate Hutchins</a> wear the <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Scarlett Mini Skort</a></span> and thought it could be the one.</p><a href=# class=buttonWidgetButtonLink_b94rpwz rel="sponsored nofollow"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a3412651a654-abercrombie-skort-2.jpg></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£52 at Abercrombie & Fitch</p></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>$60 at Abercrombie & Fitch US</p></a><p id=e7ZhK3YeJx data-wc=61>So, it's technically a skort not a skirt, but the added lining when wearing something so short can only be a good thing. Featuring a high waist with a side zipper closure and slightly elasticated back waistband, it's so flattering as it's slim-fit but doesn't cling to your stomach. Small was the perfect size for me, but it is definitely mini.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eiDKIo1M7o data-wc=46>I could have spent even more time in store, but after buying everything I'd tried on, I thought any longer could be dangerous. With it's previous reputation, it's easy to overlook, but don't rule out Abercrombie for your new season staples. <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">It's also stocked on ASOS</a></span>.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Wide-leg trousers are trending right now and these are my favourites" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/b1e96e5d576e-wide-leg-trousers-spring.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Wide-leg trousers are trending right now and these are my favourites" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Wide-leg trousers are trending right now and these are my favourites</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="We've found the best leather trousers and leggings to wear with everything this spring" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/24fa4967c7ee-leather-trousers-d.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="We've found the best leather trousers and leggings to wear with everything this spring" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>We've found the best leather trousers and leggings to wear with everything this spring</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I tried the trending £38 high street jeans loved by Frankie Bridge - these are my honest thoughts" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/216971e5b808-frankie-bridge-jeans.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I tried the trending £38 high street jeans loved by Frankie Bridge - these are my honest thoughts" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I tried the trending £38 high street jeans loved by Frankie Bridge - these are my honest thoughts</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
