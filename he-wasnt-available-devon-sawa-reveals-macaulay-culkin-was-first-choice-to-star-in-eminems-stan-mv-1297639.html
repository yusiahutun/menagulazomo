In a recent chat with Entertainment Tonight, Devon Sawa, who famously appeared in the 2000 video, spilled the beans that he wasn't the initial choice for the role.</p><p>"They actually reached out to Macaulay Culkin first," the 43-year-old Chucky actor spilled. "I think they had him in mind, but for some reason, he wasn't able to do it or maybe he just wasn't interested."</p><p>Devon Sawa spilled the beans about how he ended up in Eminem's "Stan" music video. Turns out, it wasn't originally meant to be him! Nope, they actually had their sights set on Macaulay Culkin first.</p><p>But, alas, Macaulay wasn't available or maybe just not keen on it. Then, out of the blue, Dr. Dre, who was apparently binge-watching Final Destination, had an epiphany.</p><p>He thought, "Hey, why not Sawa?" Someone in the casting office had a connection to Sawa, and voila, he got the call. Talk about a twist of fate! And you know what? Sawa's pretty chuffed about it. He's even said it's one of the proudest gigs he's ever had. But, of course, it wasn't all smooth sailing. There were definitely a few hurdles to jump over along the way. <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","&#39;He Wasn&#39;t Available&#39;: Devon Sawa Reveals Macaulay Culkin Was First Choice To Star In Eminem&#39;s Stan MV",1297639,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/nobody-is-forced-to-do-anything-on-show-luann-de-lesseps-stands-with-andy-cohen-amid-mcsweeneys-lawsuit-against-him-1297340","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/he-wasnt-available-devon-sawa-reveals-macaulay-culkin-was-first-choice-to-star-in-eminems-stan-mv-1297639","Content Also read","entertainment","hollywood"),triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","&#39;He Wasn&#39;t Available&#39;: Devon Sawa Reveals Macaulay Culkin Was First Choice To Star In Eminem&#39;s Stan MV",1297639,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/nobody-is-forced-to-do-anything-on-show-luann-de-lesseps-stands-with-andy-cohen-amid-mcsweeneys-lawsuit-against-him-1297340","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/he-wasnt-available-devon-sawa-reveals-macaulay-culkin-was-first-choice-to-star-in-eminems-stan-mv-1297639","‘Nobody Is Forced To Do Anything On Show’: Luann De Lesseps Stands With Andy Cohen Amid McSweeney’s Lawsuit Against Him","Also_Read","entertainment","hollywood")'><strong>‘Nobody Is Forced To Do Anything On Show’: Luann De Lesseps Stands With Andy Cohen Amid McSweeney’s Lawsuit Against Him</strong></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h2 id=6625f8d0ceabb><strong>Sawa Reflects on Filming Eminem's Iconic 'Stan' Music Video</strong></h2><p>Remember that time when they told me I had to lip-sync on the day of shooting?

It was like a hip-hop extravaganza! Three days of pure madness, but man, was it epic.
