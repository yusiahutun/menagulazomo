For 20 years she worked as a child protection barrister and was even appointed as a trustee of National Museums Liverpool by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport in 2008.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ee8bc7f9972b-nisha-katona.jpg><p id=eOatI4jQvmN data-wc=71>But beneath the surface bubbled a passion for cookery, and for sharing her culture. "I had a very happy job as a child protection barrister. I was secure and content, but this dream of bringing the way the Indians eat at home to the streets, came to my mind like a migraine, and would not leave me until I gave much of my life to give life to Mowgli," she recalls.</p><p id=eHk6HmP1ypQ data-wc=44>She says not taking a leap was not an option. "I always describe entrepreneurism&nbsp;like eczema!," Nisha tells us. "It is an itch that afflicts&nbsp;you if you are one of the burdened few&nbsp;destined to risk it all, for no guarantee of success."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">more take a leap</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Everything I wish I knew before running the London Marathon for the first time" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/5cb298b5cf7c-london-marathon-georgia.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Everything I wish I knew before running the London Marathon for the first time" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Everything I wish I knew before running the London Marathon for the first time</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="My empty nest at 59 shocked me into changing my life" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/2e253aee0a54-image00001.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="My empty nest at 59 shocked me into changing my life" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>My empty nest at 59 shocked me into changing my life</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="The BBC's Louise Minchin: 'How I finally found my sense of adventure after 45'" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/f9344a790433-louise-minchin-extreme-sports.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="The BBC's Louise Minchin: 'How I finally found my sense of adventure after 45'" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>The BBC's Louise Minchin: 'How I finally found my sense of adventure after 45'</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="How a five-week solo holiday changed my entire life" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/44f3187b94c2-amy-chapmancredit-jerrysun-xiaoxuan-jerry-sun.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="How a five-week solo holiday changed my entire life" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>How a five-week solo holiday changed my entire life</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eAr5kjjDCO0 data-wc=30>To say the risk paid off would be an understatement.

"I realised that, unless I built Mowgli and captured the ancient recipes of my ancestors - in my cookbooks and in an eatery, my elders would take the way that Indians really eat to the grave with them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/960a870be202-nisha-katona-restuaranteur.jpg><p id=ezW91HFtFu_ data-wc=32>"There was far too much to lose.

But for Nisha, she was able to put her feelings of apprehension to one side in pursuit of her goal.&nbsp;</p><p id=eUmJTyESIiU data-wc=54>The author of explains: "The other fascinating trait of entrepreneurs is that we tend to be glass-half-full people. We are eternal optimists and tend to keep our heads down, and we’re driven by whatever guiding light it is that leads us on. Real entrepreneurs build, despite the dissenting voices around them.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9a5d00f82383-nisha-katona-cookbooks.jpg><p id=eOFx8bmoaW7 data-wc=49>"I risked everything I had, and put all my life savings into Mowgli," she continues. "It’s never an option for a founder.
