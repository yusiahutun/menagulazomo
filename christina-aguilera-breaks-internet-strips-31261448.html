One wrote: “What an incredible time to be alive and lived this era!!!”</p><p>While somebody else echoed: “This album is just a masterpiece!! I remember that my mom took me to the store to buy it! You don’t even know how this album helped me, thank you queen.” And a third fan said: “An ALBUM!!!! Saved lives, taught self love, made you feel sexy! This is what music is supposed to do. Touch you, make you think, feel good. You did that!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31241521.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_dsfdjfdaz.jpg><p>It comes after Britney Spears gave a shout out to Xtina in her new memoir The Woman in Me. She worked alongside Christina, Ryan Gosling and Justin Timberlake on the Disney Channel’s Mickey Mouse Club back in the day, when Britney was only 11.</p><p>An excerpt of the book obtained by People magazine reads: “Being in the show was boot camp for the entertainment industry: extensive dance rehearsals, singing lessons, acting classes, time in the recording studio, and school in between.</p><p>“The Mouseketeers quickly split into our own cliques, divided by the dressing rooms that we shared: Christina Aguilera and I were the younger kids, and we shared a dressing room. We looked up to the older kids – Keri Russell, Ryan Gosling, and Tony Lucca, who I thought was so handsome. And I quickly connected with a boy named Justin Timberlake."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p><b>For more of the latest showbiz news from Daily Star, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters </b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#><b>here.</b></a></p><p>Christina appeared a little worried about the memoir when she appeared on Jimmy Kimmel’s chat show, only telling him: “I’m hoping that everything is all good with her. Everything’s beautiful. The future should be celebrated.”</p><p>Kimmel prodded her to see if she really wanted to be mentioned, telling her: “For real, because I would like to be in it.” Christina then said: “Maybe you will be in it. Listen, I’d rather it be you than me. So hopefully you’ll be in it. You’ll make the book.”</p><p><b>Follow Daily Star on Threads </b><a href=# rel=nofollow><b>here.</b></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKuYpMSjtdlorKxlo528uK7Is2acoKKewLW1zZpkmp%2BlnrmmvsBmmaudkaDAbrXNrZyrppWperTA0aKnrGVjZn93fZNtbw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
