The lovebirds slipped on each other in the cafeteria when Brandon acted like he was running into Jen because he needed a fork.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/09/08/jen-hatmaker-1599557544.png width=450 height=440 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span class=imageCaption>J</span> <strong><span class=imageCaption>Jen Hatmaker, Brandon Hatmaker.</span></strong> <strong><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Instagram</span></strong><p>Right after college graduation, Jen and Brandon tied the knot on December 30,&nbsp;1993. In addition, the pair set an example of an idle couple and successful marriage, as they have been together for over three decades.</p><p>After marriage, Jen and her husband lived in several places like Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, and Colorado. Consequently, they settled down in Austin and founded a Church. They aggressively indulged themselves in charity work along with work in the church.&nbsp;</p><h2>Jen Hatmaker Filed for Divorce</h2><p>Christian author Jen Hatmaker filed for divorce from her husband, Brandon, on September 7, 2020. The reality show star, who's been hitched to Brandon for 26 years, filed for divorce in Hays County 22nd District Court in Texas on August 21.

On July 31, the Kansas native asked for prayers via Facebook without clarifying the "crisis" her family was navigating.</p><p>But has Jen been dating anyone after her divorce from her former husband, Brandon Hatmaker? As of December 2021, Jen appears to be single. Not to mention, Hatmaker's name is also not romantically linked with any man.</p><p>Hatmaker's main focus, for now, remains on her children. Besides anything else, Jen is doing great as a single independent mother while raising her children as she simultaneously focuses on her work.</p><h2>Jen Hatmaker's Children</h2><p>Jen Hatmaker is a mother to five children- three sons,<strong> Caleb Hatmaker</strong>, <strong>Gavin Hatmaker</strong>, and <strong>Ben Hatmaker</strong>; and two daughters, <strong>Sydney Hatmaker</strong> and <strong>Remy Hatmaker</strong>.
