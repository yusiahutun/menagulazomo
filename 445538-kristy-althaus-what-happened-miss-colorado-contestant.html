Her parents and siblings, if any, are not in public. Additionally, her ethnicity and religion are a mystery.</p><p class=align-left>However, the former beauty queen attended a local high school before pursuing <a href=#>higher education</a>. So, ''where did Kristy Althaus go to college?'' The precise institution is unknown, but she started modelling while still in school.</p><h2>Career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/98cdd5cfdcf4cbee.jpg><p class=align-left>In 2012, Kristy participated in the Miss Colorado Teen USA pageant. She came out second after Jacqueline Zuccherino. However, her position meant that she could step in if the winner could not fulfil her duties.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, about one year later, an adult video emerged online. Althaus was featured in the clip seated on a bed in front of a camera and a man behind the camera asked her how old she was, and if this was her <a id=https://answersafrica.com/kristy-althaus-stripped-colorado-teen.html href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first video</a>.

But unfortunately, the Miss Colorado scandal <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cost Kristy</a> her hard-earned title. Shortly after the clip's release, the pageant promoters, Future Productions, erased all references to the <a href=#>beauty queen</a>. In addition, they removed her name from the official website and deleted a YouTube video where the competition's results were announced.</p><p class=align-left>Surprisingly, there was no confirmation that Kristy was the one on the video. The Miss Teen Colorado 2012 runner-up deleted her Twitter account when the drama unfolded. Neither Althaus nor the event promoters made an official statement about the scandal.</p><p class=align-left>The incident raised diverse reactions from netizens globally, claiming that she didn't do anything unlawful.
