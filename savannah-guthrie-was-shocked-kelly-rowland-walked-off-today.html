“She was lovely. I had no idea, no inkling that anything was amiss,” Savannah, 52, told Page Six on Wednesday, February 21. “She was as sweet, and kind and professional as she ever was. I don’t know what happened behind the scenes.”
The incident began when Kelly, 43, joined Savannah for an interview on the morning talk show to promote her new Netflix film, Mea Culpa."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I had no idea, no inkling that anything was amiss,” Savannah, 52, told Page Six on Wednesday, February 21. “She was as sweet, and kind and professional as she ever was. I don’t know what happened behind the scenes.”</p><p>The incident began when Kelly, 43, joined Savannah for an interview on the morning talk show to promote her new Netflix film, Mea Culpa. In the <a href=#>now-viral clip</a>, the broadcaster pried the Destiny’s Child alum for information on former bandmate <strong>Beyoncé</strong>’s new country album.</p><p>“What do you think about your friend Beyoncé,” Savannah asked Kelly. “She’s like your sister, you guys literally grew up together — she’s stepping into country.”</p><p>“I’m so proud of her,” she simply responded, leading Savannah to say, “I know, but were you surprised and what do you think about it?”</p><p>“I’m so proud of her,” Kelly replied. “So happy for her.”</p><p>The exchange led viewers to deem Savannah as <a href=#>“disrespectful” toward Kelly</a> and her latest project in posts shared on X. Kelly was then supposed to serve as a guest cohost next to <strong>Hoda Kotb</strong> later on in the broadcast. Instead, she ended up <a href=#>walking off the set</a> of the show. Initially, <a href=#>Page Six</a> reported that the Grammy winner was unhappy with the dressing room she was provided with backstage.</p><p class=x_elementToProof>It has since been reported by other outlets that she was unhappy with the nature of the questions during the interview. <strong>Rita Ora</strong> ended up stepping in as a guest cohost instead of Kelly at the last minute.</p><p>​​“After 28 years of knowing her, Kelly Rowland remains one of the kindest, most amiable humans I have ever met and have had the blessing to represent,” Kelly’s rep, <strong>Yvette Noel-Schure</strong>, told Entertainment Tonight on Tuesday, February 20, following the Today appearance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/savannah-guthrie-was-shocked-kelly-rowland-walked-off-today-set.jpg><p>Savannah also seemingly <a href=#>addressed the controversy</a>, hinting that the dressing rooms backstage could use a bit of a refresh.</p><p>“We need a remodel. We need Extreme Makeover: Today Show Dressing Room Edition,” she told Entertainment Tonight on Wednesday. “We are in a historic studio, 1A. It’s the same studio that has been used for decades. It’s incredible and it’s iconic, but it’s old … You get the good with the bad … If you want history, sometimes you’re gonna have a few little chips of paint coming off the wall.”</p><p class=x_elementToProof>“We try to do our best,” she added. “Hopefully, the main thing is how people feel and the reception that they get, a warm hug from all of us on the show, ’cause we’re really grateful for them coming.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46smK%2BZnqOuqXnGrquhqpmaerit0maqoaeToLKlecqeo6WxXae8uLjAp5tmr5GhuKawjKidn2WkpLGixY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
