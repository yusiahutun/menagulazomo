That'd be Simon Porte Jacquemus, the French designer I may or may not have an equally supersized crush on. (Can you blame me?)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jacquemus, 28 (!), started his eponymous label at 19, and now everyone wants a taste of him. The self-taught Paris Fashion Week wunderkind has landed a spot on the Business of Fashion 500 and was a finalist for the 2014 and 2015 LVMH Prize—a big deal for fashion people.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Indeed, the man is talented, turning to nostalgic images of life in the South of France for inspiration and cranking out collections that will make you lust after sun-soaked beaches and margarita-fueled vacations. And his larger than life hat isn't his first accessories hit. On the opposite side of the size spectrum, his teeny-tiny $478 micro Le sac Espelho bags are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>nearly out of stock</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sidebar: He's also easy on the eyes. Do yourself a favor and peruse his Instagram feed. The shirtless photos are a little thirsty, but whoever said staying hydrated is a bad thing?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Devilishly handsome smile and abs aside … let's get back to that hat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jacquemus struck gold when he designed this year’s most coveted accessory, aptly named the Le grand chapeau Bomba. The list of models and perfectly tanned muses who’ve worn it so far reads like a Fyre Festival (R.I.P.) VIP-only list, Emily Ratajkowski included.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Obviously, the hat is absurd. It’s enormous. It's over-the-top. There’s nothing practical about it, nothing subtle. Inevitably, someone will make fun of you for wearing it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And yet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I’d wear this stupid hat to the beach, or for a stroll in the park. I’d wear it to hide from people I don’t want to say hello to. If I flipped it on its head, I’d even carry it as a clutch. Why? I mean, why not? Call me ridiculous, but I’d gladly save up my well-earned coins to get my paws on the Bomba hat. If I’m spending money on an off-the-runway piece, you bet I’m blasting a photo of myself in it all over social media. I'm not ashamed to admit: I'd do it for the 'gram.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sure, it’s designed for women, but even the designer has proven boys can wear it well, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So why don’t I own it? Again, I blame the influencers for perhaps being too good at well, influencing—it's sold out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sure, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>you can score the extra-large version for $697</a>, the cost of a new wardrobe from Zara or a round-trip ticket to Europe during the off season, but for those of us ballin’ on a budget, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>smaller (yet still grossly, perfectly oversize) $431 version</a> is sadly sold out. And before you ask, yes, we checked <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Net-A-Porter</a>. Gone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Simon, if you’re reading this, please produce more of them—I’ll buy it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As with any great fashion piece in the year 2018, the Jacquemus hat is not without a bit of controversy. To make an incredibly long story short, Diet Prada, an Instagram account that calls out designers for ripping off or um, heavily borrowing ideas from other labels, targeted Jacquemus for mistakenly identifying a different hat worn by Bella Hadid in Vogue Mexico as his own.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jacquemus originally shared the image of Hadid in the large, floppy hat on his page, and Diet Prada pointed out Hadid's topper was actually by Olmos & Flores. He deleted the Hadid images from his profile and called Diet Prada “fake news.” Since the whole shebang went down, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>some fashion leaders have criticized Jacquemus</a> for using language that resembles the harsh words of President Donald Trump.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sigh! All this over a stupid hat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But look, big hats are having a moment (have you seen <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>this very magazine’s August cover?</a>). And if there’s one accessory I personally would shell out the dough for, it’s Jacquemus’s “Bomba” baby. Anyone want to go halfsies?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGealrCywcSmrKxlnJZ6o7vMm5hmoJGperS0zqk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
