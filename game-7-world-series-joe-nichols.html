On Team Nichols it's Joe and his 13-year-old daughter, Ashelyn. On his wife Heather's team is all of her East Texas family. Unfortunately for Joe, they had home field cheering advantage last night."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

On his wife Heather's team is all of her East Texas family. Unfortunately for Joe, they had home field cheering advantage last night. He tells Taste of Country that he watched Game 6 -- and will possibly be watching Game 7 -- from his in-law's home near Jefferson, Texas.</p><p>"I'm amongst all Rangers fans," he says, laughing. "They're all from Texas. And here in Texas it's kind of a funny thing because you know it's all about the Cowboys around here. And I think the Rangers are kind of a bonus. Everybody is excited because the baseball team is doing great."</p><p>Was that a hint of trash talk? Did Joe Nichols just accuse Rangers fans of being a bandwagon bunch?</p><p>Heading into tonight's game in St. Louis, country artists are squaring off as well. <a href=#>David Nail</a> joins Nichols as a Cardinals fan while <a href=#>Neal McCoy</a> and <a href=#>Scotty McCreery</a> are rooting for the Texas Rangers. Nail will be singing 'God Bless America' during the seventh inning stretch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmoJmdmnp4edaoqaWcXaiys7XErGSjp5Viu6qvx6ijrGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
