She lives with her husband and five-year-old daughter.</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Gem is an entrepreneur who jumped on the clean eating bandwagon just in time - and her risky move has certainly paid off. Indeed, a few years ago, the concept of eating cauliflower rice would repulse many but it's become one of the biggest health food success stories this year.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Gem, who started her career at Unilever in the Philippines (where she is originally from), decided to take the leap and co-found the healthy food start-up.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Her idea lead her to becoming a finalist of the Virgin Media Business’ VOOM competition last summer and since then the company has come on leaps and bounds.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Gem works with farmers in Cambridgeshire to produce the product, which she then sells on to supermarkets such as Tesco, Waitrose, Sainsburys and ASDA.&nbsp;</span></p><img id=i-7b3620b1d9d0d7ce src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/06/13/12/35372E4B00000578-3627891-image-a-5_1465817484198.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Gem Misa, 37, from London, is the co-founder of Cauli Rice - a healthy low calorie, low carb alternative to rice" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Gem Misa, 37, from London, is the co-founder of Cauli Rice - a healthy low calorie, low carb alternative to rice</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Discussing her entrepreneurial journey and whether she faced any challenges due to her gender, she said: 'Setting up a business is never easy. From my understanding, entrepreneurship and raising finance for start-ups have always been a male dominated category but I’ve never felt that limitation as I believe that the success we’ve had on the business was based more on the quality of the idea and the product rather than on whether the person running it was male or female.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'To run a business, you need a lot of support (and patience!) from your loved ones,' she said. 'As we moved from a double income to a single income household, my husband had to work to support the family single-handedly for a long time while I got the business up and running. It’s taken four years to get to a point where he has left his job and now works with me.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Despite her stellar success, Gem describes her routine as 'unglamorous' and 'manic' as she rushes to get her daughter fed and ready for school. 'I like keeping late afternoons free to spend time with my daughter, but unfortunately this means going back to work after she’s gone to bed at around 8pm. I usually work until 10pm or 11pm then wind down by chatting with my husband before heading to bed at midnight,' she said.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Exercise is a very important part of my routine. Without it, I start feeling sluggish and lethargic. Because my business schedule can vary day to day, I always have a gym bag ready and try to fit a class in 2-3 times a week. Exercise helps me think more clearly about any challenges that we’re experiencing and it always helps me distress.'&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Candidly discussing her view on whether women can really have it all, Gem admits that they must prioritise, which often leads to making some sacrifices.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'I believe you can be successful at what you set your mind to, but this can take a lot of time and focus. This would mean also having to prioritise. For me, my priorities would be time with my family and building a successful business – but unfortunately this doesn’t leave room for a lot of socialising or sleep!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Ultimately, women have all the right skills for success – don’t let anyone convince you otherwise.

And people in fashion definitely value and judge on first impressions.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'I do sadly feel that owning a business and meeting with specifically men in financial institutions, I do have to work harder to prove myself. When you walk into serious meetings, sometimes the assumption is that because you carry a designer handbag and wear fabulous heels that you have your head in the clouds. However, it is just so satisfying to prove them wrong and leave with their utter respect.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'That said, as everyone with their own business knows - it's hard. Very hard. Not only to manage the business needs but also to balance home life with work life.

'When people ask how I fit in time for exercise, I always tell them I don’t have time not to run.

Then I love making my kids breakfast and it’s become a bit of my love language to them,' she said.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Rather refreshingly, Jessica admits that whilst her husband is a great support system now, this wasn't always the case. 'It wasn’t easy,' she admits. We both grew up with families that expected to do more of the child rearing and have her career take a back seat to the male provider. We had to figure it out. My husband is incredibly supportive of my career now, and has stepped up to be the most hands-on, caring father I could imagine.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'In the end, I had to give up my supermum act, trying to do all things for all people at all times.
