From my understanding, entrepreneurship and raising finance for start-ups have always been a male dominated category but Iâ€™ve never felt that limitation as I believe that the success weâ€™ve had on the business was based more on the quality of the idea and the product rather than on whether the person running it was male or female.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'To run a business, you need a lot of support (and patience!) from your loved ones,' she said. 'As we moved from a double income to a single income household, my husband had to work to support the family single-handedly for a long time while I got the business up and running. Itâ€™s taken four years to get to a point where he has left his job and now works with me.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Despite her stellar success, Gem describes her routine as 'unglamorous' and 'manic' as she rushes to get her daughter fed and ready for school. 'I like keeping late afternoons free to spend time with my daughter, but unfortunately this means going back to work after sheâ€™s gone to bed at around 8pm. I usually work until 10pm or 11pm then wind down by chatting with my husband before heading to bed at midnight,' she said.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Exercise is a very important part of my routine. Without it, I start feeling sluggish and lethargic. Because my business schedule can vary day to day, I always have a gym bag ready and try to fit a class in 2-3 times a week. Exercise helps me think more clearly about any challenges that weâ€™re experiencing and it always helps me distress.'&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Candidly discussing her view on whether women can really have it all, Gem admits that they must prioritise, which often leads to making some sacrifices.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'I believe you can be successful at what you set your mind to, but this can take a lot of time and focus. This would mean also having to prioritise. For me, my priorities would be time with my family and building a successful business â€“ but unfortunately this doesnâ€™t leave room for a lot of socialising or sleep!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Ultimately, women have all the right skills for success â€“ donâ€™t let anyone convince you otherwise.

And people in fashion definitely value and judge on first impressions.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'I do sadly feel that owning a business and meeting with specifically men in financial institutions, I do have to work harder to prove myself. When you walk into serious meetings, sometimes the assumption is that because you carry a designer handbag and wear fabulous heels that you have your head in the clouds. However, it is just so satisfying to prove them wrong and leave with their utter respect.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'That said, as everyone with their own business knows - it's hard. Very hard. Not only to manage the business needs but also to balance home life with work life.

The technology sector also struggles with not having enough female engineers or women leaders.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Inspired by her own experience and after giving birth to her daughter, Julie admits her professional outlook changed. 'I had a strong desire to take on new challenges and create a portfolio career, seeking out non-executive directorships at a relatively young age. I now hold various board positions (chairing the Innovation Committee at Aberdeen Asset Management, for example).</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'I also decided to take another career leap, this time away from corporate boardrooms into the very different world of tech entrepreneurship, launching a new product from scratch.'&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Julie's brainchild - Rungway - is essentially a free app for people to seek advice by posting questions on a wide range of topics, from office politics, and dealing with health issues at work, to a funny story from their day and mastering that much sought-after work-life balance,</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Striving for a work-life balance is something that Julie has just about mastered. She wakes at&nbsp;7am to take her daughter to school before she heads into meetings. 'I typically get going on emails over my cereal, then we have a lovely walk to school.

She lives with her husband and two young children.</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Born and raised in America, Jessica proved her entrepreneurial flair early on after she dropped out to co-found her first company, a wedding based content and commerce site, which went on to become WeddingChannel.com and is still one of the largest online wedding companies today.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She then moved to work at Dell Computers by day, and worked on her new business idea - a jewellery company - by night.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>After early growth and funding, in 2007, she changed the name to Stella & Dot. By 2011, the company sat &nbsp;at number 57 on the Inc.500/5000 Fastest Growing Private Company list.

Making the most of your time is essential for extraordinary success.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She wakes at 5am and likes to exercise to clear her head and take some time for meditation before waking her children up. 'When people ask how I fit in time for exercise, I always tell them I donâ€™t have time not to run. A thirty-minute run in the morning before work gives me hours of higher-quality energy later, so itâ€™s like Iâ€™m saving time. Then I love making my kids breakfast and itâ€™s become a bit of my love language to them,' she said.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Rather refreshingly, Jessica admits that whilst her husband is a great support system now, this wasn't always the case. 'It wasnâ€™t easy,' she admits. We both grew up with families that expected to do more of the child rearing and have her career take a back seat to the male provider. We had to figure it out. My husband is incredibly supportive of my career now, and has stepped up to be the most hands-on, caring father I could imagine.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'In the end, I had to give up my supermum act, trying to do all things for all people at all times.

Define what authentic happiness means for you, and then go out and create that life. New challenges may feel daunting at first, but feel the fear and do it anyway.
