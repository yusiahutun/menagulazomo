It feels like just yesterday I was terrified of the buzzing swarm flocked around ice cream wrappers at the pool, my freaked-out self trying to remain frozen so they didn't sting me. I'm proud (?) to say I still have yet to be stung, but in the years since, I've come to appreciate their mammoth impact on the environment — and according to thrilled shoppers, the insects are also responsible for their best skin ever.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Thankfully, it's not because of Gwyneth Paltrow's wilding-out approach to the "thousands of years old treatment called apitherapy," which involves being stung by bees to allegedly get rid of inflammation and scarring. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">CosRx's Full Fit Propolis Light Ampoule</a> is infinitely more pleasant to use, and according to shoppers, the moisturizing, softening, redness- and acne-fighting formula makes fine lines disappear unlike anything they've experienced before.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The hydrating serum uses a minimalist combination of bee-derived propolis extract, Chinese senna extract, hyaluronic acid, panthenol, and arginine to get the job done. The namesake propolis is created by bees to coat the exterior of the hive, and that protective quality means it nixes acne-causing bacteria and aging free radicals while helping <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>your skin regenerate faster</a>. "I feel like it's shedding years off! I'll definitely be getting bottle after bottle," one Ulta shopper writes of the high propolis-content mix. "My skin looks so radiant and so many people have complimented me."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$28; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">ulta.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even people who thought the reviews were exaggerated say they're stunned at how well the serum banishes zits overnight, even before they surface. The "magical stuff" also moisturizes skin dehydrated from acne medication, shoppers say, leaving younger-feeling skin in its wake — and 41-year-old reviewers say the $28 serum competes with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Sunday Riley products</a> at a fraction of the cost.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That checks out, since supermodel Emily Ratajkowski, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>noted fan of the brand</a>, relies on <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">CosRx's moisturizer for plump, ageless skin</a>. Others say that in the space of a week with the ampoule, their skin smoothed out and regained a glow they hadn't seen since they were in high school. "I am so blown away by how young my skin looks," one more shopper writes, and countless others mention how <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the non-oily serum</a> tones down redness while lifting and tightening wrinkles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just three drops of the "miracle working" formula is enough to see your skin plump up and take on an ethereal luminosity, and it's so hardworking that shoppers say it's cut down their skincare routine without missing out on any results. Those with ample dark marks and discoloration say that it "literally fixed pigmentation in as little as three days" — and the effect is so drastic, it instantly makes their skin look supple and airbrushed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"In just hours, it's done more than my moisturizer has done in years. My skin looks almost blurred and feels soft and hydrated," another adds, and one person going through chemotherapy writes that in the face of dreadfully peeling skin, the "miracle in a bottle" ampoule was the single thing to restore their soft, bouncy, and dewy complexion. Bottom line?<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">The prettily packaged serum</a> is a fast-acting magic touch for fine lines, acne, scars, and every other skin concern under the sun. Bees! I'm sorry I ever doubted you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1omqiroq16sb7OqaaloaNiuaqzx61kmqWgpMKtsYyuo62Z</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
