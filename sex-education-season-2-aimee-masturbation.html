I adore Laurie Nunn’s Netflix hit Sex Education. As a 30-year-old, it brings me much pleasure knowing those awkward teenage moments of becoming a sexual being are behind me. I don’t often relate to the storylines, but season 2 had a shockingly common sexual assault storyline that was all too close to home. 
Aimee Gibbs, played by Aimee Lou Wood, in episode 3 endures a horrific act of sexual violence while riding a public bus in broad daylight."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I was 27 and visiting a historic site while traveling. I was alone in a room when a smiling man asked me to take his photo. I smiled back and obliged. I returned his phone and he grabbed me, demanding a selfie. I went along with it, not wanting to anger him.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sex-education-season-2.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>He firmly grabbed my waist and moved his hand under my shirt.

Micro sexual aggressions are traumatizing and the show captured the grim reality of such assaults. Dr. Henry says it’s not unusual for survivors to be triggered by watching a fictitious occurrence.</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Survivors often relive the event by seeing it played out on TV which can evoke fear, shame, guilt, disgust, anger, helplessness, and denial,” Dr. Henry says. “Survivors should enact healthy coping mechanisms when they find themselves triggered, such as talking about the show with a therapist, watching the show with a trusted friend in order to not experience the scenes alone, or turning off the program altogether and refraining from watching any more of it.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>She also notes that the show should have had a trigger warning. If I had known the storyline I wouldn’t have watched the season. ”Being able to expose yourself to depictions of sexual violence isn’t a sign of being healed or making progress,” Dr. Henry says.</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sex-education-season-2-6.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>It’s Aimee’s connection with her female friends that finally helps her speak about the trauma that being forcibly masturbated on has caused her to have. In episode 7, Aimee confesses to her peers that she’s struggling. Each of the teenagers shares their own experiences with sexual assault. It’s a chilling scene that hones in on the reality that even teenagers are enduring everyday: acts of sexual violence. The students band together and take the bus with Aimee to school in an epic TV moment of female empowerment.</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1.5><p>Like Aimee, my sense of security was shattered after I was attacked.</p></figure><p class=p1><span class=s1>“No survivor has to heal in isolation. Sisterhood provides a safe space for survivors to process what they’ve been through,” Dr. Henry says. “When survivors are together, as we saw at the end of the second season, they can freely share their anger, shame, guilt, fear, and feel validation.”</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Like Aimee, my sense of security was shattered after I was attacked. I continue to be cautious about being kind to male strangers. I make it clear that I won’t be intimidated.
