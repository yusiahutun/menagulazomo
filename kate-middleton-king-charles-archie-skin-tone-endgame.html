She said this information was relayed to her by Prince Harry. When Winfrey asked who made the statements, Meghan declined to reveal their identities, saying it would be “very damaging” to their reputations.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Scobie said he had identified the royals who discussed Archie’s skin tone, but did not include their names in his book because U.K. libel laws prevented it, according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/king-charles-princess-kate-identified-british-press-royals-105305587 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Good Morning America" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Good Morning America</a>.
