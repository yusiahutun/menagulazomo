Philip published a photo of himself and his mum on Instagram with the message,</p><p><strong>“The Queen Mother and Prince Philip” (colorized, 1997).</strong></p><p>Bolden also shared photos from his first NBA game with his father, late NBA standout player Kobe Bryant. On Kobe’s birthday, he shared this memory with his followers, saying,</p><p><strong>“Kobe Bryant is and always will be my favorite athlete.”</strong></p><p>Following the ad, he gave me and my parents tickets to my first NBA game (we beat the Nets 113-101). After that, my brother and I went down into the tunnel, and he took ANOTHER picture of us. IN ADDITION, he signed a game ball.</p><p>We never asked for anything, and he always provided because that was the type of man dad was. So determined, yet so humble. I’ve held these items for nearly 20 years, but I never anticipated they’d possess the meaning they do today.</p><p>Not anytime soon. When I think about what happened, I get sick to my stomach. But guess what? He hasn’t left. He lives on in our memory, whether he was terrifying the competition on the court or winning an Oscar off it.</p><p>So, my brother, happy birthday.</p><p><strong>“I hope there’s a dope court in heaven, and that the angels don’t get too irritated when you put 81 points on ’em.”</strong></p><p>Along with his incredible parents and profession, there is an unanswered question: “What is Philip Bolden doing now?” Bolden is continuously active in the entertainment world, now portraying Travis Lewis / Travis in the TV series ‘Millennials (I).’</p><p>We can’t wait to keep you updated on the star’s progress in everything.</p><h2>Philip Bolden’s Career</h2><p>Bolden is a blooming young actor with amazing skills who has more than 20 acting credits.
