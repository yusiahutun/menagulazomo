He and his older sister occasionally acted in the same projects, including the Disney Channel original movie Tiger Cruise in 2004 and American sports comedy Racing Stripes in 2005.</p><p>Panettiere's more recent projects include roles in The Walking Dead and How High 2, both in 2019. When not working, he shared his graffiti-inspired art <a href=#>on Instagram</a> with his followers, using a portion of the proceeds to benefit Ukraine and its citizens amid the ongoing war in the country. Hayden Panettiere has also worked to raise funds for Ukraine in recent months, and she's got a personal tie to the country, as she shares a 7-year-old daughter with Ukrainian former professional boxer Wladimir Klitschko.</p><p>TMZ reports that Panettiere was attached to five new projects when he died.
