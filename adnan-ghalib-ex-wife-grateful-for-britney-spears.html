"I [also had] a lot of people-pleasing behaviors and was consistently trying to prove my worth in order to be loved.

"He told me a lot of intimate details [about her] … even mental health stuff."</p><p>She recalled the moment she learned of Ghalib's affair with Spears, which came to light in January 2008 after photos surfaced of the paparazzo and singer locking lips in a parking lot.</p><p>"I'm pretty sure I called him, yelling and screaming. I probably texted him 50 times and waited for him to come back," Berry said, adding that the moment was "extremely traumatic" looking back.</p><p>Spears <a href=#><strong>wrote about Ghalib</strong></a> in her memoir, The Woman in Me, without referring to him by name, simply calling him "the photographer." In the book, the 42-year-old claimed that she didn't know he was married and she was "essentially his mistress," but credited him with helping her with her depression and giving her the "attention I needed," calling it a "lustful relationship."</p><p>Meanwhile, Berry told Us Weekly that Spears' father, Jamie, tried to "inform Britney of my existence." However, she alluded that she understands why Spears didn't believe her father.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:302cd767-1148-47f7-8280-d951f88f2b22 data-container-ref=toofab:article:4cc9265d-0608-4545-9cfb-72779b57f836 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/96/5by4/2023/12/20/965ef9d7ff254b7dab80eec188152137_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty / Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Sam Asghari Reveals 40 Lb Weight Loss Transformation After Britney Spears Split</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"If you have a choice between listening to someone who has kind of ripped away your identity and the hot guy with a thick accent that's willing to treat you like a human being, you're going to get what you want out of it," Berry said.</p><p>Ultimately, however, Berry is "grateful" that Spears' romance with Ghalib ended her marriage.</p><p>"I'm so f--king grateful that, for whatever reason, this unbelievable person walked into my husband's life and removed him from mine," she admitted, adding that she thinks her ex manipulated both her and Spears.</p><p>"He was very charismatic.

I know for a fact that I would've killed myself if I stayed in a toxic relationship."</p><p>Berry -- who works in the wellness space -- filed for legal separation from Ghalib in January 2008, before Ghalib filed for divorce in June 2008. Berry said she cut all ties to her ex-husband two years ago, with Us Weekly reporting that Ghalib wrote her a handwritten note that featured a two-sentence apology.</p><p>He didn't respond to the outlet's multiple requests for comment.</p><a id=gallery-link-9c1d8c0d-77f3-4ea8-a67b-0eab43867a0e class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:9c1d8c0d-77f3-4ea8-a67b-0eab43867a0e data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:4cc9265d-0608-4545-9cfb-72779b57f836 data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/54/4by3/2023/10/24/543cf033042f48a7a79a2e9d81f3e045_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pma25flrGvrc1mnqGZnJ6vbrHXZq6inpVitLOt056drqRdm7yzecGroK2mla56tLzEmqmsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
