Nguema was put on trial, accused of having perpetrated atrocities, and shot by firing squad in September 1979.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Aware of the situation, Kim Il-sung checked in regularly, over the phone or through an aide, whether the three children were doing well at school.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He was kind,” Macias recalled. “President Kim Il-sung was always a person whom I was and am thankful to – not on a political level but on a personal level.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘Abandoned by 3 countries’: the Chinese-North Koreans in South Korea</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After rising to power, President Obiang of Equatorial Guinea sent an envoy to bring Macias’ four children back home from North Korea as well as Cuba, where Macias’ eldest brother, Teo, was studying at the time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Then-Cuban leader Fidel Castro allowed Obiang’s envoy to take Teo back to Equatorial Guinea.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Unlike Fidel Castro, Kim Il-sung refused to send us back to Equatorial Guinea.
