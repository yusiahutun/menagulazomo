&#34;David Lee Murphy came into the write with me that day with a full chorus, maybe minus one line, but it was pretty much a full chorus,&#34; Hayslip tells Taste of Country of the new Aldean single, which features fellow co-stars Eric Church and Luke Bryan."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"I don't know where any of that stuff comes from. Sometimes it's something somebody has said. Ben and I always have a good time writing together. That just popped into my head."</p><p>"That’s the only way I know /&nbsp;Don’t stop till everything’s gone /&nbsp;Straight ahead never turn round /&nbsp;Don’t back up, don’t back down /&nbsp;Full throttle, wide open /&nbsp;You get tired, you don’t show it /&nbsp;Dig a little deeper when you think you can’t dig no more /&nbsp;That’s the only way I know," Murphy wrote in the chorus.</p><p>"I got the idea, as far as how to do the verses, I said maybe we should just rap these verses... do something crazy," Hayslip recalls. "We got talking about it. Jason had just come off 'Dirt Road Anthem,' which was a rap, so we thought we would put a little more melody to it than a rap. We kind of met in the middle. He's not singing and he's not rapping, he's just kind of halfway talking the verses. We turned it into a really cool song."</p><p>"Well I grew up in one of them old farm towns / Where they hit it hard till the sun goes down / Nobody really seemed to care that we were living in the middle of nowhere / We just figured that’s how it was / And everyone else was just like us / Soaking in the rain baking in the sun / Don’t quit till the job gets done," they wrote in the opening 'The Only Way I Know' lyrics.</p><p>"That was&nbsp;a song nobody else heard," says Hayslip. "That song went one place, and that was Jason Aldean, and he cut it. A lot of songs we write, they bounce around for two or three years to find a home. That song found its home with the first artist who heard it. That is a songwriter's dream. We don't always do that, but that day we were sitting down to write a song for Jason Aldean."</p><p>"One of my biggest goals coming into this year was to get a Jason Aldean cut," continues Hayslip, who was recently named ASCAP's Songwriter of the Year for the second year in a row. "I'm just a huge fan of what he does. I think what he does and what I do are very similar as far as lyrically. That was a big goal of mine. I was telling everybody I know... I am going to get on the Jason Aldean record somehow, and we ended up getting on there two times. It's really cool."</p><p>"It was fun to write," Murphy says. "I remember when we demoed it, I listened to it like 100 times, over and over. The demo was so cool. This record is the same way. I still put it on and listen to it a bunch of times."</p><p>He adds, "I like all three of those guys, and it's just a great opportunity to have three of the hottest guys right now on one song."</p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Listen to Jason Aldean feat.
