The pair had a strong bond until the very end of the actress’ life before losing her battle with breast cancer.</p><h2><strong>When Did Suzanne Somers and Patrick Duffy Meet?</strong></h2><p>Patrick and Suzanne first met when they were cast as Frank Lambert and Carol Foster on the sitcom <a href=#>Step by Step</a> in 1991. They quickly became the best of friends.</p><p>“She was a mentor in the very beginning. She’s sitcom gold,” he said of his costar in an April 2021 interview with Entertainment Tonight. “I was ready to do a comedy, but she was the one who, you know, I would do a bit or a part of a scene or something and I’d always glance over at her — she’d give me a [winks] or an ‘mmm,’ whichever one. And then we found our footing and it was, again, the best job I ever had.”</p><p>Patrick always admired Suzanne’s love and dedication to her husband, <a href=#><strong>Alan Hamel</strong></a>, and her son, <a href=#><strong>Bruce Somers Jr.</strong></a></p><p>“She’s a mother above all else,” he added. “She’s a caretaker. She’s just one of the best people. She’s a go-to person. If I ever needed something, I know I could pick up the phone and say, ‘Suzanne, I really need help on this.’ It would be there.”</p><h2><strong>What Did Patrick Duffy Say After Suzanne Somers’ Death?</strong></h2><p>Following news of Suzanne’s death, Patrick and several of his Step by Step costars shared sweet tributes to their late friend.</p><p>“I lost another friend Sunday, she became my dear friend on the first day we met and it never faltered to this moment,” the Dallas alum exclusively told Closer in a statement. “I will continue to converse with her but simply in a different way. But with the love and gratitude for her being. I know too well the feelings felt by all who loved her and most deeply by her family. To them, I send my love and strength.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Suzanne-Somers-and-Patrick-Duffys-Friendship-Before-Her-Death-.jpg><p>Patrick further reflected on his friendship with Suzanne and their final interaction before <a href=#>her death</a>.</p><p>“I am not alone in wishing I had one more face-to-face with her and Alan, but had we had that meeting last Friday I would still be yearning for just one more today,” he told <a href=#>People </a>following the devastating news. “It is the painful beauty of our present human reality. What strength and support I can muster I send to Alan and Bruce and her family and to her I say, When the stone of your life dropped in this pond you made quite a ripple, my friend. Thank you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46srLOZnqOybr%2FOppyrq12Wu6V5z5qrq6GToHqlwcWfsKxllqe2prrDrJ%2BiqF2Xsqe70Z5koZ2iYrGmrdOhZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
