"I have found the one whom my soul loves. When you know, you know… and it was only a matter of months before I realized that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with this woman."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She’s loved me at my worst, and helps sharpen me to be at my best," he wrote of Seefeldt. "She’s a direct representation of God’s love, and I thank Him every single day for her."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Dawson Knox proposes to Alex Seefeldt.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=0><p><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Bri Photography/Brianna Garofalo</a></p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>The photos captured Knox down on bended knee in front of his now-fiancée, the couple embracing and kissing after she said "yes," and their loved ones surprising them with festive sparklers in hand. A final shot showed the group setting off confetti cannons in celebration of the couple.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Seefeldt — who describes herself as an athlete and personal trainer in her Instagram bio — shared <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>a video</a> of the proposal on her page, writing in the post's caption that it was "the easiest YES of my life."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"God is SO good," she added.

"I can’t wait to embark on this journey with you. God bless the broken road that led me straight to you."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Several of Knox's Bills teammates left congratulatory messages on Knox's post, including safety <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Damar Hamlin</a>, who cheekily wrote, "Lover boyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy 🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾," and wide receiver Stefon Diggs, who commented, "Congrats knoxyyy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fellow tight end Mike Gesicki slipped in a joke about Buffalo's famously cold and snowy winters. "Man, Buffalo looks so nice this time of year," he quipped, referring to the oceanside proposal setting. "Congrats to both of you, so exciting." Meanwhile, Kansas City Chiefs tight end <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Travis Kelce</a> added, "Congratulations Daws!!! 🍻🥂"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Knox's engagement news even got a shout-out from Pro Football Hall of Famer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Thurman Thomas</a>, who retired in 2000 and still holds the all-time Bills rushing record with 11,938 yards.

Back in October when the surgery plans were announced, Bills offensive coordinator Ken Dorsey told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Buffalo News</a> that Knox's absence on the field was going to be "an adjustment" for the team.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Obviously, Dawson's a great player for us," he said. "He does so many different things in a variety of different roles, both as a blocker and as a pass catcher. So it's definitely going to be an adjustment for us — one that we got to figure out."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Kqs6ety6hkm6GcocBusMCwqqimXaC7sMSMnqWgmZeasW6Ek2pnbm5h</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
