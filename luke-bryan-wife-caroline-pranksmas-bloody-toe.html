Bryan'smom LeClaire was the target of the first day of Pranksmas, but for Day 2, Caroline set her sights on KK Ellis -- a relatively new hire to her Best Bad Influence apparel and merchandise line -- with a gory prank."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Caroline wrote on social media, along with a video demonstrating how she used the fake toe, plus some liberal squirts of fake blood, to create a prank that is truly not for the faint of heart.</p><p>The clip shows Caroline pouring the fake blood over her foot before "falling" onto a broken-down cardboard box and screaming for help. The singer's wife demonstrates some pretty serious acting chops in the seconds that follow, delivering a series of screams and gasps that truly make this prank believable. Ellis runs over and tries to say calm, turning to ask another person to call 911, before Caroline gives away the joke with a big grin.</p><p>"Oh my God," a stunned Ellis screams as the camera goes into slo-mo mode. "I thought her toe fell off! I was like, 'This is a nightmare!'"</p><p>But in the Bryan household, being on the receiving end of a terrifying prank means you're officially in the club. "Best part is she kept saying, 'her toe fell off!!' Welcome to the family," Caroline wrote at the conclusion of her social media post.</p><p>After an extensively-planned Day 2 prank on Ellis, Caroline kept things simple for Day 3 of Pranksmas, posting a compilation "scream reel" video of a variety of family and friends getting surprised by air horns, confetti, scary masks and more.</p><p>Caroline's commitment to Pranksmas is especially impressive this year, as underwent an <a href=#>operation on her hip</a> in November to address multiple issues, including "a torn labrum, hip dysplasia and a lot of arthritis," she revealed in a mid-November Instagram Stories post. As she recovered from surgery, Caroline was using a wheelchair and crutches to get around -- but that didn't stop her from getting into the holiday pranking spirit.</p><p>The Bryan household has once again opened up Pranksmas to fans this year,<a href=#> calling for video submissions</a> of people pranking their loved ones. The Top 10 pranks will be featured on Caroline's social media, and they'll also receive a $200 Visa gift card. The Pranksmas Contest is open through Dec. 22.</p><p><strong>See Country Music's Best Love Stories:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpa2bmnqjvtiapWavmZuybq%2FAq6aloZ6aerG%2BwKeirKWRqHqjuM6om7JlpKSycA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
