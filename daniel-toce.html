More significantly, he was highlighted in many news for sexually assaulting his 15 years old stepdaughter.</h3><h2>Daniel Toce Married Life With Kim Zolciak, children & Subsequent Divorce</h2><p><strong>Daniel Toce</strong> and RHOA's star <a href=#>Kim Zolciak-Biermann</a> exchanged the wedding vows on September 24, 2001, in Destin, FL, at a beach. Prior to their matrimony, both were married once and even had kids from previous marriages. It was reported that Daniel has two kids from his first wife, <strong>Kimberly</strong>, whereas Kim bore a daughter named <a href=# rel=noopener>Brielle Biermann</a> from her past relationship.</p><strong><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/06/07/daniel-toce-along-with-his-first-wife-kimberley-and-kids--1591511441.jpg width=450 height=299 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span class=imageCaption>Daniel Toce, along with his first wife, Kimberley, and kids. </span></strong><span class=imageSource><strong>SOURCE: Panda Gossips</strong></span><p>Speaking of their married life, Kim and Daniel were blessed by a daughter named <strong>Ariana Biermann</strong> on October 18, 2002. Toce had a bad habit of drinking and using drugs. So, the former couple got divorced on February 11, 2003.&nbsp;</p><h2>Daniel Toce Imprisoned for Sexual Assaults</h2><p>Daniel came into the spotlight to marry a reality television star, but that's not the only instance why the headlines were made. Daniel had been the subject of national news when he was charged in early 2011 with sexual assault. He was charged with molesting a 15-year-old girl and was also serving some time in prison for that. For all of us, the news was surprising, because the victim of his malicious intent would be nothing but his step-daughter, Brielle Biermann.</p><strong><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/06/07/daniel-toce-accused-of-sexually-assaulting-his-step-daughter--1591511597.jpg width=450 height=295 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span class=imageCaption>Daniel Toce accused of sexually assaulting his step-daughter. </span></strong><span class=imageSource><strong>SOURCE: Radar Online</strong></span><p>The assault came when Brielle had been living with her parents for two years, the revelations made by the then-15-year-old were as shocking as our heart broke when we heard what she had to say. Daniel began to sexually harass her when she was just 14, according to Biermann. He continued to harass for a whole long year before she eventually stood up to him to speak out.&nbsp;</p><h2>Daniel Toce Made his Step-daughter Pregnant</h2><p>Daniel not only sexually assaulted Brielle but also physically abused her, according to the victim herself. She also acknowledged having gone through abortion in 2012. Brielle has lodged a lawsuit after having found the courage to stand up to him.</p><strong><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/06/07/kim-biermann-snapped-with-her-daughters--1591511757.jpg width=450 height=450 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span class=imageCaption>Kim Biermann snapped with her daughters. </span></strong><span class=imageSource><strong>SOURCE: Instagram</strong></span><p>The Reality TV star 's ex-husband spent ten years in jail but had to serve only over two years before he was placed on probation. Although he managed to shorten his time in prison, this marked the end of his relationship with Zolciak-Biermann.</p><h2>Daniel Toce Career & Net Worth</h2><p>There is nothing to talk about the professional life of Daniel as he rose fame, becoming the former spouse of Don't Be Tardy's star. However, some sources have revealed that he is the son of a business tycoon. But, he has not disclosed any personal information of him regarding the early life, parents' names. To tell you the truth, Toce never came up to the public eyes following his split up with Kim. Moreover, Daniel's net worth is under wraps.</p><strong><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/06/07/kim-zolciak-captured-with-husband-kroys-and-kids--1591511943.jpg width=450 height=437 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span class=imageCaption>Kim Zolciak captured with husband Kroys and kids. </span></strong><span class=imageSource><strong>SOURCE: Daily Mail</strong></span><p>On the other hand, his ex-wife, Zolciak, holds the net worth of <strong>$1.5 million</strong> as of 2020. Though there is no information of Daniel's present condition, Kim, together with her husband, <a href=# rel=noopener>Kroy Biermann</a>, and her six kids, is undoubtedly living a relish life.</p><p><strong>Stay intuned with <a href=# rel=noopener>marriedwiki.com</a>, for more <a href=# rel=noopener>Biographies</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>News</a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener>Articles</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDsKCkoV6YvK571qKiomeUlruqsctmq6iblQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
