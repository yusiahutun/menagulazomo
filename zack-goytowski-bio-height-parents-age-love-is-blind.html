He signed up for the show searching for love and based on what we know about him, he clearly deserves it. There are tons you need to know about his personal and professional life.</p><p>Learn about his career, a single mom who raised him and his sister, and more as this article proceeds.</p><h3><strong>Love Is Blind: Are Zack Goytowski And Bliss Poureetezadi Still Together?</strong></h3><p>Bliss Poureetezadi and Zack Goytowski from Season 4 undoubtedly won the hearts of many, given that they took a route that few had traveled before them. Soon after joining the Netflix social experiment, Bliss and Zack started falling for one another. The latter explained that it was untrue after initially introducing himself as a purported stripper by the name of “Zack Attack.”</p><p>Zack revealed that his mother was a single parent who used to work as a stripper to support the family. He had been single-mindedly devoted to his job since she died, yet he yearned for his own family.</p><p>Bliss was excited to go on more dates with Zack after hearing his story and admiring his courage. They connected over the fact that their moms had each given their children a special dedication to the well-known song “I Hope You Dance” by Lee Ann Womack. Events like these developed their relationship, and Bliss even made Zack some cupcakes for his birthday on her own initiative.</p><p>Irina, who was then dating him, decided to perhaps do something kind for her potential partner and ask Bliss for a candle after seeing her baking. The latter, feeling “icky,” refused to divulge and was worried that Irina, who would shortly meet with Zack, would spoil her surprise for him. Zack showed his gratitude for the gift to Bliss when they later met on the latter’s birthday and discussed how Irina had informed him they had gotten into a fight.</p><p>Bliss expressed her displeasure with the latter’s activities, calling them “mean and sabotaging.” She questioned whether she could trust Zack’s assessment of people’s moral character if he admitted that he could envision falling for either her or Irina.</p><p>The two started discussing their families during their subsequent date when Bliss revealed that none of her ex-boyfriends were particularly liked by her father. She explained that her father didn’t think they were good enough for her when asked why, something he presumably would never say about anyone.</p><p>This infuriated Zack since he had frequently faced judgment from the families of the people he loved due to the circumstances of his upbringing and he want acceptance from his future wife’s family.</p><p>Zack was heartbroken that he had to leave Bliss behind, but after giving it some thought, he decided to pop the question to Irina. But after their catastrophic vacation to Mexico, they split up. Zack met Bliss when he got home and said that he had made the wrong decision, knowing that she concurred. It is quite likely that the two reignited their romance given the history behind them.</p><h3><strong>Zack Goytowski Ideal Girlfriend</strong></h3><p>In his bio, Zack Goytowski shared that his “high standards” was the biggest obstacle in his dating life. But, he knows what he wants in his ideal partner. Coming into the show, Zack was looking for an intellectual connection with a “type A, introverted and bookish” person who can match his “driven” personality.</p><p>He added that “steak … and a thoughtful gesture” are the keys to Zack’s heart unless things get derailed by his habit of “arguing for fun.”</p><h3><strong>Zack Goytowski Age</strong></h3><p>Zack Goytowski is 31 years old as of March 2023.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Zack Goytowski Parents?</strong></h3><p>Zack Goytowski was raised by his late single mother Terri Jo Vannoy. Terri’s life was not easy. As a teenager, she lost her father to a fatal car accident. Terri welcomed Zack shortly after. As a single mother, Terri raised two children with no more than a high-school diploma. She overcame both her bipolar disorder and addiction so that she could care for them.</p><p>Terri struggled financially living in absolute poverty but she never gave up. But through her determination, she pulled her family out of absolute poverty.</p><p>Zack astonished everyone when she overcame her hardships and began working full-time serving the mentally and physically disabled. With a heart generated by love, she served them like they were her own family. She bathed them, sang songs with them, and made sure that each person felt special and important. In doing so she impacted the lives of countless men and women who needed to feel loved.</p><p>Terri died in a fatal vehicle collision on 10 April 2014. She was 42 years old at the time of her death.</p><p>Zack has one younger sister named Alexa Williams who is a mother self to a beautiful daughter.
