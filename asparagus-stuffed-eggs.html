A good lot of them are in <a href=#>From Julia Child’s Kitchen</a>; published in 1975, it contained recipes and kitchen wisdom that came from episodes of her PBS show. Gentler to novices than her Mastering the Art of French Cooking classics, the recipes were probably more familiar to American audiences, things like leek and potato soup, sauteed chicken breasts with tarragon and tomatoes, and, here, a riff on deviled eggs that I am making my mission to rescue from obscurity.</p><p><span id=more-11722></span></p><p><a title="does anyone eat their eggs in order?" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3732/13717953395_428a9b32ae_z.jpg alt="does anyone eat their eggs in order?" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="covering with cold water and ice cubes" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3742/13717977873_8e3abbd6c8_z.jpg alt="covering with cold water and ice cubes" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>I’m a big fan of the hard-boiled egg; I find that keeping a few in the fridge makes for an easy breakfast with a slice of whole-grain cinnamon toast, a wholesome way to add protein to a lunch salad, or for snacks. My favorite way to eat them is slightly undercooked, peeled, halved and schmeared with the thinnest film of mayo and then sharp Dijon, followed by a few flakes of sea salt, but Julia Child’s version might be their highest calling: the potential to stuff their centers with something like a balanced meal, or at least a really gush-worthy appetizer.</p><p><a title="simmer to cook" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm3.staticflickr.com/2933/13718352524_2710d76e83_z.jpg alt="simmer to cook" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><a title="pureed in a food mill" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7382/13718355844_2bc6820691_z.jpg alt="pureed in a food mill" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="drain the puree a little, just do it" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7407/13717985393_3962c9bfbb_z.jpg alt="drain the puree a little, just do it" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>We’re mostly talking about asparagus today, but these can be made with whatever spring vegetables your markets are gracing you with, from artichokes and spinach to, I suspect, favas and peas. You cook whatever you’re using until it’s fully tender, cool it, puree it and I fear, this is where I’ll lose you, but you’re going to need to drain this mess too. Julia has you wring it in a towel. Julia is so awesome that she then tells you how to clean that towel so the stain does not set. Nevertheless, I found that dolloping it on a stack of paper towels for couple minutes worked perfectly, and allowed me to persevere towards my lifetime goal of doing as little laundry as possible.</p><p><a title="hard-boiled and halved" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7388/13717963435_090056d5b1_z.jpg alt="hard-boiled and halved" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="sieve the yolks by deb, on Flickr" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7095/13717988083_ba2c71c96f_z.jpg alt="sieve the yolks" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="filling, mashed with asparagus" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7052/13717990253_352a3529f2_z.jpg alt="filling, mashed with asparagus" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>If you’ve thus far only imagined deviled eggs as goopy with mayonnaise and very rich, these will be a pleasant surprise. Mayo is an option, but not a requirement, as is Dijon mustard. What’s wonderful about them is how much they taste and look like spring, wherever it may be <a href=#>hiding</a>.</p><p><a title="asparagus-stuffed eggs" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm3.staticflickr.com/2874/13717994423_4312726286_z.jpg alt="asparagus-stuffed eggs" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="asparagus-stuffed eggs" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm3.staticflickr.com/2902/13718364204_7302294ebf_z.jpg alt="asparagus-stuffed eggs" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><b>Cooked Eggs, previously:</b> <a href=#>Caesar Salad Deviled Eggs</a>, <a href=#>Egg Salad with Pickled Celery and Coarse Dijon</a> and Smoky Deviled Eggs with Crisped Jamon and Crushed Marconas in the <a href=#>cookbook</a>.</p><p><b>Passover recipes:</b> Mostly dessert, plus one brisket and soup, <a href=#>over here</a>.</p><p><b>Good Reads:</b> <a href=#>Are back by popular demand.</a> Productivity is overrated; reading blogs is not. :)</p><p><b>Facebook:</b> Are you finding that new updates from the <a href=#>Smitten Kitchen Facebook page</a> aren’t showing up in your News Feed?

In each case you’ll want about 2 tablespoons drained purée per 6 whole eggs, and you’ll want to cook the vegetable until tender, blend it and drain the liquid a bit as explained below before mixing it into the mashed egg yolks. Adjust flavorings to the ingredient; artichokes go wonderfully with lemon zest and mayonnaise; peas with cream and mint.</p><p>Yield: 12 stuffed egg halves</p><p>6 large eggs<br>4 medium asparagus spears<br>2 teaspoons very finely minced shallot, scallion or chives, plus a pinch extra for garnish<br>3 tablespoons mayonnaise, whipping cream, creme fraiche, sour cream and/or soft butter<br>1/2 teaspoon smooth Dijon (optional)<br>Few gratings fresh lemon zest (optional)<br>Salt and pepper to taste</p><p>Hard-boil eggs using whichever method you prefer. I cover mine with cold water, bring it to a boil, then set a timer for 9 1/2 minutes. When it rings, drain the eggs, and plunge them in ice water until they’re fully cool. Eggs can be cooked ahead of time and stored in the fridge for up to 4 days.</p><p>Cook asparagus spears in salted simmering water until full tender, about 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and plunge in cold water. Drain and again and spread on towels to dry out as much as possible. Cut 1/2-inch off the tips of each spears and cut these tips lengthwise (they’ll be your garnish). Puree remaining asparagus — I found that my food processor didn’t do a great job due to the small volume, but yours might. A food mill with a fine disc works well here.</p><p>You’ll want to remove the excess water from your puree; I did so by spreading it for a minute on a few paper towel layers. If you don’t, the filling will be soggy and damp, or in Julia’s words, “a disappointing texture and flavor.”</p><p>Peel your eggs. Dip your knife in water before cutting each in half lengthwise for a cleaner cut. Shave a thin strip off the bottom of each so that it will not rock about in its dish. Remove the yolks and press them through a fine-mesh strainer to sieve them. Add asparagus puree, shallot or chives, mayonnaise or cream, Dijon or lemon zest (if using) and combine mixture until smooth. Season carefully with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</p><p>You can spoon the mixture into each egg half, or use a piping bag with a star tip for a fancier presentation. Decorate each stuffed egg with a reserved asparagus tip (you’ll be a little short of what you need), and the remaining with the extra shallot, scallion or chives. Wrap tray in plastic and keep in fridge until ready to serve.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-11722 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-11722 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
