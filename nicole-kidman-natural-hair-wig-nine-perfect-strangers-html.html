Masha has a reputation for her alleged ability to completely transform <a href=#>Tranquillum House guests</a>. When a new group of nine guests arrives for their 10-day retreat, they quickly realize Masha might have some twisted methods.</p><p id=par-3_39>Masha is certainly a unique person, so Kidman took plenty of time to prepare for the role. For five months, the actor got completely into character. She <a href=#>only responded to Masha</a>, and she emulated some of Masha’s actions.</p><p id=par-4_83>“I wanted a very calm healing energy to emanate all the time, so I remember going over to people and sort of putting my hand on their heart, holding their hand, they would talk to me or use my name Nicole when I would completely ignore them,” she said, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a>. “The only way I could actually relate to people was that way because I felt like otherwise, I would be doing a performance, and I didn’t want to feel that way.”</p><h2 id=h-nicole-kidman-s-natural-hair-is-red-and-curly>Nicole Kidman’s natural hair is red and curly</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_43>Kidman has natural red curls, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">PopSugar</a> reported. However, she has often dyed her locks blond, in addition to sporting wigs in all different styles. She wore her natural hair in some of her earlier movies, like Moulin Rouge and Eyes Wide Shut.</p><p id=par-6_26>Since then, Kidman has rocked many different styles, from short brunette bobs to platinum blond waves. At red carpet events, she often wears blond, straight hair.</p><p id=par-7_56>Kidman wowed many of her fans in 2019 when she sported her fiery red curls once again for HBO’s The Undoing. As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Women’s Health</a> reported, the Big Litle Lies star once revealed that she wanted to be an “Aussie beach girl” when she was younger, which led her to bleach and straighten her hair frequently.</p><p id=par-8_38>However, after some time, Kidman began to miss her natural curls, which had become damaged. To bring the locks back to life, she likes to <a href=#>use hair oil</a> and leave it natural when she’s off the clock.</p><p id=par-9_36>“I have naturally curly hair that’s constantly being styled when I’m working. So when I’m not working, I love saturating it in this nourishing oil and leaving it alone,” she said, according to Women’s Health.</p><h2 id=h-the-actor-said-wigs-help-her-in-creating-different-characters>The actor said wigs help her in ‘creating different characters’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-10_60>With wanting to keep her natural curls healthy, it’s no surprise that Kidman might sometimes prefer to wear wigs for her projects. Additionally, during a radio interview on The Kyle and Jackie O. Show, the actor said the wigs often help her get into character. However, she doesn’t have a favorite wig, and she still enjoys using her natural hair.</p><p id=par-11_45>“I’m using my own hair now, so I think that’s probably my favorite, is my own hair,” she said, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yahoo</a> reported. “There’s many times where I use my own hair as well because it’s so easy, and then other times I’m creating different characters.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7qq%2FOpZxmo5mZuqK6jKeYra2ilrlutMCiqWavmZx6r7XNnmSpnaKbsqTAjKyrq5menLKzv42hq6akXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
