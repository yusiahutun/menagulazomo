From her red sequin dress to her shimmering<strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Zara frocks</a></strong> - we've wanted everything she has stepped out in. In the final, the raven-hair beauty wowed everyone with her blue sequin suit - which is actually from <a class=hm-link href=#>Millie Mackintosh</a>'s now defunct fashion brand. The sparkling two-piece co-ord can still be purchased on Amazon for £61.40, but there is limited sizes left. Claudia, 46, teamed the suit with a pair of smart black high heels that matched the lapels on her jacket. As always, the entire look was hand-picked by Sinead McKeefry - stylist to the stars who also frequently works with Fearne Cotton. Claudia shared a shot of her latest outfit with her co-host Tess Daly on Instagram ahead of the show and wrote: "Final lift shot. We're on in 10."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d9af68af0a8f-claudia-winkleman-tess-daly-instagram-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e4xCY_ihJTgN data-wc=8><strong>Claudia brought the sparkle in her sequin suit</strong></p><p id=eT5P2yzFF1DY data-wc=65>Millie Mackintosh commented on Claudia's photo, writing: "I thought I recognised that suit! Looks amazing on you," followed with a red heart emoji. The Former Made in Chelsea star took to Instagram&nbsp;in March to inform her fans that her namesake fashion label had gone into&nbsp;liquidation.&nbsp;It was reported that Millie had £500,000 of debts and she lost over £178,000 from the company's collapse.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p style=text-align:center id=ekMFXwhJESCy data-wc=5><strong>WATCH: HELLO! chats to Claudia</strong></p><p id=eZGXr-tfWcmu data-wc=19>The fashion brand was on the shelves for over four years ago and was a huge hit on ASOS.</p><p id=eFdUFu2kk3Fy data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Loved Claudia Winkleman's Sunday night Strictly dress?

So, it is with great sadness that I have had to make the very tough decision to close it. Despite our best efforts and being a top seller with a number of stockists, the financial climate in the fashion industry has proved immensely challenging and the business is no longer sustainable. The unwavering support from friends, family, influencers, the industry and customers has made the decision even harder."</p><p id=eE9BE9tGdFkY data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Claudia Winkleman divides opinion on Strictly in her green glow-in-the-dark shoes</a></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
