Being in the industry for almost two decades, it’s no wonder the star has a tight security team around her. But fans noticed hers seemed to be particularly tight, as they assumed one was “packing weapons” undercover.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1978655986-731x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-miley-cyrus-bodyguard-seen-with-suspicious-umbrella-at-the-grammys>Miley Cyrus’ bodyguard seen with ‘suspicious umbrella’ at the Grammys</h2><p>As the singer walked down the Red Carpet in her dress, made from safety pins, some eyes were distracted by her bodyguard, whom social media users were told to “play close attention to.”</p><p>Users claimed the guard was concealing his weapon in an umbrella or under a plastic limb. Despite all the theories flying around, it’s said this is a ‘very common’ thing to do.</p><p>“So if they are a licensed protection officer, which I would imagine Miley will have, then there’s every good chance that he will be carrying a weapon anyway,” security specialist Will Geddes <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> LADbible.</p><p>He then explained the ‘tactical umbrella’ is a tool used by many <a href=#>celebrity</a> security guards, “as a weapon, but they can also be used if you have someone who’s either trying to jump in on your principal, trying to throw something at your principal, or even a very intrusive paparazzi. You could obviously open that umbrella and use it as a shield.”</p><p>It’s also important to note there is no indication the bodyguard was carrying anything other than the umbrella. LA has seen higher levels of rainfall over recent days, so the umbrella was likely a smart move.</p><p>Whilst on stage at the event, the 31-year-old caused a stir in other areas, as she announced she had <a href=#>‘forgotten her underwear’</a> in front of 20,000 people.</p><p>Luckily, there were no safety threats, or wardrobe malfunctions, so a good night all around.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-star-snubs-father-billy-ray-in-speech-after-feud>The star ‘snubs’ father Billy Ray in speech after ‘feud’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1128907781-1024x683.jpg><p>It was an eventful night for the Flowers singer, who caught the attention of audiences, after ‘snubbing’ her father Billy Ray from her thank-you speeches.</p><p>“My mommy, my sister, my love, my main gays because look how good I look,” she said. Miley then went on to say she doesn’t think she’d forgotten anyone else, except her underwear. Obviously, fans noticed she had ‘purposely’ left out her father.</p><p>Feud rumors have been floating around ever since 2022, following his split with her mom, Tish, after 30 years. Billy Ray remarried musician Firerose, who is 27 years his junior, last year, which isn’t said to have helped.</p><p>As well as her father, Miley also missed her younger sister Noah, 24, and brother Braison, 29, from her victory speech.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2WDcLPRmqSmsaNiuqq4xLJknLGiqsBurs6dsKCtkaextHnSrqqpoZOevLa%2FjK6km6qVobmiecisZK%2Bdoq56pLvMpqanZaOWxrR5xLGnnqqkZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
