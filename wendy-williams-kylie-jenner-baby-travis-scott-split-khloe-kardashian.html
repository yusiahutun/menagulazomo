"Like, the condom split, she took the test and was probably like, 'Oh my god, what do I do now? Travis!' He's like, 'No, I'm a rock star. You got plenty of money on your own, figure it out ... I'll pay child support from afar.'"</p><p>She then addressed Jenner's social media blackout, her <strong><a href=#>omission from the family Christmas card</a></strong> this year, and the latest "Keeping Up with the Kardashians" promo <strong><a href=#>teasing some big news</a></strong>. "People are saying that's when Kylie will finally reveal she's pregnant," said Wendy. "I don't think so. Is she pregnant or are we being bamboozled?"</p><p>"She's only 20, you know what I mean. Remember when you were 20, you didn't want anything to do with a baby," she continued, before countering that Kylie's 20 "is like 35."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:9a9973c2-b866-5b71-b10c-57d2dfae658a data-container-ref=toofab:article:345ad758-e0cf-5fe6-b40f-1d1047cc6901 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/34/5by4/2018/01/08/3443961412565a1faa28896f8542f019_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kardashians Tease 'Big' News Next Week as World Awaits Kylie Jenner Pregnancy Confirmation</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"She grew up on TV in front of us. She's got the mid-crisis makeover already. Let me tell you something, you can do whatever you want to yourself, but the baby is still going to look like the old you," Williams added, "Just saying."</p><p>Williams assumed that Jenner was looking for "something authentic" in her life after "dealing" with Tyga, his son, Blac Chyna and Caitlyn Jenner's transition.</p><p>"But 20, with a baby. And then we're going to be judging her parenting skills," she said. "Is she out with the baby? Does she have a whole bunch of help? Is travis part of the baby's life?"</p><p>"Good luck Kylie," she said near the end of the segment. "And Travis, please do right by this girl!"</p><p>Williams then congratulated Khloe on her pregnancy, saying, "Good for you, Knloe, I'm happy for her."</p><a id=gallery-link-42c0b81f-8783-5768-88ac-acfeec508d37 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:42c0b81f-8783-5768-88ac-acfeec508d37 data-poster-image-ref=toofab:image-asset:image_jpg_20171225_71a8312f12995b4bba3f0e6f74c84bb3 data-start-at-poster data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:345ad758-e0cf-5fe6-b40f-1d1047cc6901 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/71/4by3/2017/12/25/71a8312f12995b4bba3f0e6f74c84bb3_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Snapchat</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnl7j2pmamhfrLKvsNhmrqKknJ6urr%2BMpLCloZVit6a6zZ6pZpqRl8ZuwNGaraKrXaiwsMDTZqqppJmpeqy0y6icZqORp7Giv8eimKdn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
