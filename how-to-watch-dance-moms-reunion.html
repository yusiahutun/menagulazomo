Kendall Vertes, Kalani Hilliker, and JoJo Siwa are also on board for the special, and each of the former dancers will be joined by their respective mothers.</p><p>Sisters Kenzie and Maddie Ziegler, along with fellow OG cast member Nia Sioux, are noticeably absent from the reunion. Dance Moms ringleader, Abby Lee Miller, is also not participating in the reunion. According to a source who spoke to <a href=# rel=nofollow>People</a>, the former dance instructor was not asked to participate in the reunion. “At this point everyone has gone through different eras, had time to reflect and there’s been a lot that Abby put them through emotionally and physically and they just didn’t want to relive that,” the source shared.</p><p>The insider went on to claim that some of the Dance Moms alums—such as Maddie Ziegler—wanted “nothing to do with any of it at all” due to their past experiences, while there are others “who say they know they wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for&nbsp;Dance Moms.”</p><p>“But some of those involved decided that they would only be a part of the reunion if Abby wasn’t,” the source added. “The girls were able to speak their minds more openly without her there.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=where-is-abby-lee-miller-now>Where is Abby Lee Miller now?</h2><p>Abby Lee Miller has had a tumultuous journey since leaving the show in 2020. The former Dance Moms star was indicted in 2015 for fraud-related charges and ultimately pled guilty to bankruptcy fraud and bringing unreported money into the United States. She was sentenced to a year and a day in prison, with her sentence beginning in July 2017. She served approximately eight months at a federal prison in Victorville, California, before being transferred to a halfway house in Long Beach, California, for the remainder of her sentence. By May 2018, Miller had been released early for good behavior.</p><p>However, things didn’t get easier for the former reality star. In April 2018, shortly after transitioning to the halfway house, Miller was diagnosed with Burkitt lymphoma, a rare and aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Her diagnosis was discovered after she underwent spinal surgery for an infection. Following her diagnosis, she underwent multiple surgeries and extensive chemotherapy treatment​, putting her in remission in September 2018. Her recovery included significant physical rehabilitation. As of 2024, Miller continues to face mobility challenges, relying on a wheelchair and mobility aids to get around.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmK6sMLInqpoaWdqg3h8j2ifqK9dqbxuw8CtmqFllJa7pLGMpqamq12nsra6yKilaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
