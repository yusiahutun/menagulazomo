The duo are very close friends too, attending the <a href=#>Grammys</a> together more than once and having their own handshake. But when Jack Antonoff was asked about <a href=#>Taylor Swift’s upcoming album</a> in a recent interview, he hung up. It seems to be a sensitive topic.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jack-antonoff-shuts-down-interview-when-they-ask-about-taylor-swift>Jack Antonoff shuts down interview when they ask about Taylor Swift</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-1978664564-1024x717.jpg><p>The 39-year-old record producer hung up on Dutch news outlet NRC when they asked about her new project, which she announced at the <a href=#>awards show</a> this year.</p><p>Tay Tay is releasing her 11th studio album, <a href=#>The Tortured Poets Department</a>, next month.</p><p>But it seems Jack doesn’t want to discuss it anymore.</p><p>He <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a>: “You know I don’t talk about that. If you’re looking for clickbait, you’ve come to the wrong place. Thank you for this conversation.”</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> then hung up, and the interview was over.</p><p>He had mentioned Swift previously in the discussion, so it wasn’t completely off-topic. He compared his latest project Bleachers with the <a href=#>music</a> he has down with the Cruel Summer hitmaker. Jack has also worked with <a href=#>Lana Del Rey</a>.</p><p>He had said: “I don’t see it as producing. I create music with my friends. It comes as it comes. I’m not the kind of producer who likes to give commands from behind a mixing console.</p><p>“I concern myself with the music itself; the way in which you can manage the creative process.”</p><p>Jack added: “Success is a strange phenomenon. It distracts attention from the ordinary mechanisms that lead to good pop music.</p><p>“Being able to listen to each other well is one thing. The artists I work with trust that I can help them make their music better.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-s-new-album-is-out-in-three-weeks>Taylor’s new album is out in three weeks</h2><p>The star, who is dating <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a>, announced her new album when she won a Grammy for best pop vocal album for Midnights last month. Coming out on April 19th, fans won’t have long left to wait.</p><p>But Jack has fiercely defended his pal before.</p><p>In 2022, when Blur and Gorillaz frontman Damon Albarn claimed to the LA Times Taylor didn’t write her own songs, Jack was furious.</p><p>He ranted on <a href=#>Twitter</a>: “I’ve never met Damon Albarn, and he’s never been to my studio, but apparently he knows more than the rest of us about all those songs Taylor writes and brings in.”</p><p>Taylor herself also called him out, by saying: “I was such a big fan of yours until I saw this. I write ALL of my own songs. Your hot take is completely false and SO damaging.</p><p>“You don’t have to like my songs, but it’s really f***ed up to try and discredit my writing. WOW.”</p><p>Damon then “apologized unreservedly and unconditionally”.</p><p>It comes after <a href=#>Jack slammed Kanye West </a>because their albums (Bleachers and Ye’s Vultures) were coming out the same day.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2eEcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy06xkqaqfmcKksdFmoZqbm2Kur8DOp6afnl2drq%2Bz0masqWWnnbKveceeqmaZo6CypXnAm6aurF2dsrN5zZ6uZpmcl8Kuew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
