Besides being enjoyable to look at, having proper CD covers helps you easily identify music tracks and makes your collection feel complete.</p><p>Below, we round up some of the best sites to download high-quality CD album cover art. You can use them to perfect your MP3 collection or just collect your favorite CD cover designs.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=album-art-exchange>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Album Art Exchange</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Album-Art-Exchange.png><p>Album Art Exchange is a site wholly devoted to high-quality images of album covers, making it a great resource for anyone interested in album art.</p><p>On its <strong>About</strong> page, the founder mentions that he started the site because so much of the CD cover art online was of terrible quality. These images are often plagued with JPEG compression, poor contrast, scratches, and scans where someone didn't even take the time to remove the CD insert from its case.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>As a result, you'll find excellent album cover images here for over 650,000 albums. Just search for a specific album (or artist) to find what you're looking for. Each one displays the image size, dimensions, and user rating, so you can pick the best one for your needs.</p><p>Click the <strong>Advanced</strong> button on the search page to change sorting options. You can also use the <strong>Change Layout</strong> option at the top to display more albums per page.</p><p>If you're not logged in, you'll see a watermark on your downloads. Register for a free account using the button at the top-right first to get unmarked album covers.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=discogs>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Discogs</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Discogs-Album-Page.png><p>Discogs is one of the go-to resources for music data online. It's a huge database that collects information about artists, albums, record companies, and much more. It's no surprise, then, that Discogs collects album art images as well.</p><p>Get started by searching for your chosen album or artist using the box at the top. After you select an album, you'll see the chosen image for it at the top-left of the page. Select <strong>More images</strong> to see other pictures related to that album, such as the CD's back cover, inserts, special editions, and regional variants.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Overall, the images on Discogs aren't as high-quality as Album Art Exchange. However, the site has images for singles, compilations, and rarities as well. If you're interested in those, plus images aside from the main album art, there's a lot here for you.</p><h2 id=musicbrainz>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MusicBrainz</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MusicBrainz-Screenshot.png><p>Discogs has a lot of information, but MusicBrainz surpasses it in some ways. It's like an IMDb for music, as it allows you to see every place that a song has appeared, track music by tags and categories, find a band's internet presence, and much more.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Internet Music Guide for the Audiophile</a></span></p><p>This information can be overwhelming at first, but finding album art with MusicBrainz is pretty straightforward. Search for an artist or album name using the bar at the top-right and you'll see plenty of results for it. Select the album you're looking for, and it will likely bring up several versions from different regions of the world.</p><p>You can select a regional release if you like, but this typically isn't necessary. Instead, you can access a high-quality version of the cover art on the right side of the main album page.</p><h2 id=amazon>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Amazon</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Amazon-Album-Art.png><p>The above sites should take care of your CD cover art needs most of the time. But in case you're looking for something more accessible or can't find the CD art you want on those pages, there are other options for downloading album covers.</p><p>One of the best is right under your nose. As you probably know, Amazon sells tons of music. As part of this, the site usually features high-quality artwork on each album page. Simply search for the album that you're looking for and you can access its art easily. You'll need to right-click and choose <strong>Open image in new tab</strong> for a copy of the image that's available to save.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>However, there's a little trick to making sure that you get the highest-quality album cover when doing this. Make sure to select the <strong>Streaming</strong> or <strong>MP3</strong> formats from the list, as they provide better-quality images than the physical releases. When you open the album art in a new tab, you'll get a URL like this:</p><pre><code class="hljs javascript">https:<span class=hljs-comment>//m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91isTuBpKXL._SS500_.jpg</span></code></pre><p>The <strong>SS500</strong> part of the link indicates the album artwork is displayed at 500x500 pixels, which is decent but not great. If you change the value after <strong>SS</strong>, you can adjust the image resolution, in pixels.</p><p>For example, replace <strong>SS500</strong> with <strong>SS1400</strong> to get this link, which displays a 1400x1400 image:</p><pre><code class="hljs javascript">https:<span class=hljs-comment>//m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91isTuBpKXL._SS1400_.jpg</span></code></pre><p>We tested a few albums and found that around <strong>1425</strong> is the highest you can go before adding a white box around the image. This may differ per album, so give a few values a try to find the highest-quality version possible.</p><h2 id=google-images>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Images</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Google-Images-Album-Art.png><p>Still can't find the CD cover art you're looking for? Try turning to the world's largest image search platform. Chances are that you can find the art for pretty much any record, since Google Images searches the whole web.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>You'll have to be a bit particular when looking on Google Images, as you're likely to find poor-quality photos. You might want to set the <strong>Size</strong> option under <strong>Tools</strong> to <strong>Large</strong> to avoid tiny versions of album art files. Google Images doesn't show image dimensions on the thumbnails anymore, so you'll have to click an image and then mouse over it on the right side to check the size.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Vital Google Image Search Tips and Tricks to Know</a></span></p><p>Google Images may find some photos from the above sites, so it's up to you which search interface you prefer.</p><h2 id=try-desktop-tools-to-download-album-covers>6. Try Desktop Tools to Download Album Covers</h2><p>If you only want to grab a few album covers, the above methods work well. But they're too slow for downloading dozens or hundreds of CD covers for your collection. When you need to add art to a lot of tracks, you should use a desktop tool dedicated to the task.</p><p>One of the best tools for this is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MP3tag</a>, which makes it easy to edit music metadata, including album art. See our <a href=#>full guide to MP3tag</a> for how to use it.</p><p>There are plenty of other choices for album cover downloads, though. Have a look at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MusicBrainz Picard</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Album Art Downloader</a> if MP3tag doesn't do the job for you.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=it-39-s-easy-to-find-quality-cd-album-covers>It's Easy to Find Quality CD Album Covers</h2><p>This list of resources makes it easy to find CD cover art for any album in your collection.
