A study in the journal Scientific Reports found that people with thicker lips were viewed as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">more attractive</a>, and there has been a 1000% increase in lip fillers since the turn of the century ‚Äî&nbsp;proving that people just seem to prefer a plumper pout.&nbsp;Plus, fuller lips are a sign of youth and attract attention to the center of your face, making your face appear slimmer overall.&nbsp;But what if you don‚Äôt want to spend the money or time or feel the pain of in-office lip fillers? You may be happy to learn about a trendy new ‚Äòat-home lip filler‚Äô circulating on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">social media</a>. Similar to the old school temporary lip-plumping trick where you mix cinnamon and olive oil and dab it on your lips for a bee-stung look, this technique is the new and improved version ‚Äî and it acts like a filler in that it can keep your lips from deflating as you age too. Keep scrolling to learn more about this easy at-home lip filler, how to do it and why it works.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why do lips get thinner with age?</h2><p>Since lips lack oil glands, any sort of dehydration causes them to shrink and look even smaller, especially when they‚Äôre forced to stretch when you smile. Sun exposure and smoking can also play a part because nicotine decreases oxygen and blood flow to the lips.&nbsp;</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is lip filler?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/GettyImages-1306589585.jpg><p>Lip filler, also known as lip augmentation or lip enhancement, refers to a cosmetic procedure where a substance is injected into the lips to increase their volume, alter their shape or improve their symmetry.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúThe most commonly used filler substances include hyaluronic acid, which is a natural substance found in the body, and collagen. These fillers help plump up the lips, smooth out fine lines around the mouth and create a fuller, more youthful appearance,‚Äù says board-certified facial plastic surgeon <a href=#>Konstantin Vasyukevich, MD</a>.</p><p>Lip fillers are often used to enhance the size and shape of the lips, correct asymmetry, define the lip borders and provide hydration and structure to the lips. The effects of lip fillers are temporary and typically last several months to a year, depending on the type of filler used and individual metabolism.</p><p>Like any cosmetic procedure, lip fillers carry risks and potential side effects, such as swelling, bruising, asymmetry and allergic reactions, so it‚Äôs crucial to weigh the benefits and risks before undergoing the treatment. And it‚Äôs a great reason to consider an at-home lip filler.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the viral at-home lip filler?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/GettyImages-1264697728-1.jpg><p>The at-home lip filler on everyone‚Äôs social media feeds? A simple application of popular skincare ingredients like <a href=#>hyaluronic acid</a> and <a href=#>peptides</a>, with a lip balm like <a href=#>Vaseline</a>.</p><p>To do: Grab a peptide-based serum <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ordinary</a> and a hyaluronic serum like<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> The Inkey List</a> and put a few drops of each into a small glass jar filled with a petroleum jelly (like Vaseline or Aquaphor). Mix it all and apply it to lips three times a day for four weeks, and doctors like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Charles, MD</a>, say you‚Äôll see results! ‚ÄúThe moisture from petrolatum will help seal in this blend,‚Äù says Dr. Vasyukevich.</p><p>‚ÄúHyaluronic especially needs water to grab onto to work,‚Äù says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Erika Luren MA, MS, NP</a>, founder of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Parasol Aesthetics, Dermatology and Wellness</a>.&nbsp;‚ÄúSo make sure that lips are damp before applying and that you are drinking plenty of water and staying hydrated, and you can further boost the moisture benefits by putting a humidifier in your home,‚Äù she adds.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@drcharlesmd1 href=#>@drcharlesmd1</a><p>Derm Secret for Plump Lips üôÇ <a title=lips href=#>#lips</a> <a title=lipfiller href=#>#lipfiller</a> <a title=lifehacks href=#>#lifehacks</a> <a title=skincare href=#>#skincare</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Monkeyshine-JP - Lt FitzGibbons Men" href=#>‚ô¨ Monkeyshine-JP ‚Äì Lt FitzGibbons Men</a></figure><p>Plus, there‚Äôs little to no risk. ‚ÄúThere is no significant risk to using these ingredients topically so long as patients don‚Äôt have an allergy to any of them,‚Äù says New Jersey-based ENT <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Samir Undavia, MD</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@drcharlesmd1 href=#>@drcharlesmd1</a><p>Lip filler without the needle‚Ä¶ <a title=lips href=#>#lips</a> <a title=lipfiller href=#>#lipfiller</a> <a title=lifehacks href=#>#lifehacks</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - d3adout" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì d3adout</a></figure><p>Users say the at-home remedy is as good as pricey lip injections for a fraction of the cost (without the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">needles</a>, risk and pain). <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@DarcieRatcliff</a> told TikTok followers that with just using the hyaluronic acid, she saw bigger lips in just one week.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@darcieratcliff href=#>@darcieratcliff</a><p>Replying to @venny before & after of using Hyaluronic acid serum on my lips for a week <a title=hyaluronicacid href=#>#hyaluronicacid</a> <a title=lipplumper href=#>#lipplumper</a> <a title=beforeandafter href=#>#beforeandafter</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Real Love Baby - Father John Misty" href=#>‚ô¨ Real Love Baby ‚Äì Father John Misty</a></figure><p>Best of all, doctors say it works, too.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@Dermarkologist</a>, a dermatologist/influencer on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> says doing this can also prevent you from ‚Äúever having chapped lips again,‚Äù while <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@Dermatologysurgeon</a> says she tells her patients this is an effective treatment for plumper lips without the needles.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúThrough their plumping and hydrating powers, hyaluronic and peptide serums can plump lips while controlling inflammation and redirecting blood flow,‚Äù says Dr. Vasyukevich.</p><p>But Luren notes that it won‚Äôt have as dramatic an effect as injectable lip fillers, which plump below the surface of the skin and last longer.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>The $9 Serum That Works Like Botox + More Viral Botox Dupes You Can Do From Home</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How does the at home lip filler work?</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Hyaluronic acid in lip filler</h3><p>For starters, hyaluronic is a gooey substance that‚Äôs actually used in injectable facial and lip fillers and one that‚Äôs made naturally by our bodies. Scientists have found that hyaluronic can lubricate eyes, joints and skin.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúHyaluronic acid acts as a moisture magnet and has a powerful ability to absorb water at six times its weight,‚Äù says New Jersey-based ENT <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Samir Undavia, MD.</a> ‚ÄúWhen applied topically, it causes water to hydrate the molecule absorbed through the lip lining, temporarily causing swelling of the lip,‚Äù explains Dr. Undavia.&nbsp;</p><p>In skincare, hyaluronic acid shows up as either a high molecular weight (HMW) ingredient or a low molecular weight (LMW) ingredient. Although you don‚Äôt need to know all of its chemistry, understanding <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">molecular weight </a>distinctions can be helpful, as one or the other will be better for your lips.&nbsp;</p><p>Hyaluronic acid with a LMW (sometimes listed as sodium hyaluronate) absorbs <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">more fully into the deeper layers of your skin</a>. That‚Äôs because its molecules are so small that they can go farther in penetrating your dermal layers than HMW hyaluronic acid.&nbsp;</p><p>You might not immediately see results since LMW hyaluronic acid sits deeper in your skin. Also, LMW hyaluronic acid can‚Äôt hold as much water as its HMW counterpart. However, LMW hyaluronic acid provides longer-lasting effects.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Peptides in lip filler</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/GettyImages-1466695019.jpg><p>Peptides ‚Äî or chains of amino acids known to boost collagen production in the skin ‚Äî work similarly and pack a powerful punch for your pucker when paired with hyaluronic acid.</p><p>Just like our skin, lips age by thinning and getting fine line and wrinkles due to the collagen and elastin that depletes over time. Research shows some of the most effective collagen regenerators are peptides, i.e. tiny particles that trick the body into thinking they are broken collagen proteins which in turn prompts the skin to produce new collagen to repair the ‚Äúbroken‚Äù pieces, making peptides a powerful anti-aging ingredient for skin and lips.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúPeptides are also humectants, attracting water and pulling that hydration into the skin,‚Äù says aesthetician <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cassandra Bankson</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúPeople often forget that the lips are also a part of the skin organ, albeit a tad different being of mucosal type. Creams and serums with these ingredients can be dually purposed to slather on the face and lips at night for hydration,‚Äù says Luren, founder of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Parasol Aesthetics, Dermatology and Wellness</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Don‚Äôt want to make your own at home lip filler?</h2><p>Of course, if you don‚Äôt feel like making it yourself, there are lip balms you can buy that contain these ingredients and will give you the same effect.
