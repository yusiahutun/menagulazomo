Black Ink Tattoo Studio is a tattoo parlour found in Harlem and managed by David ‘Ceaser’ Emanuel. Don’t get cheated that the show is only about people getting or removing tattoos because this is reality TV. There is plenty of drama, love, funny moments, crazy stories and even emotional moments in the show.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a77cfb908fdb2317.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Manuel Bellazetin from Kindig-It?

They later added her to the Black Ink Crew where she is a tattoo artist, piercer and cosmetologist.

That notwithstanding, not everybody can make money as a tattoo artist or a reality star. Those that thrive in this area must not only be the very best but also have to be ready to make sacrifices in their lives. Excelling in reality television can be draining both physically and emotionally, and we have seen some Black Ink Crew members leave even though things seemed to be going well for them.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>How much do Alaskan Bush People make per show?</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2Fk2tta29dl7mir8pmoKejXZi%2FpsOMnJisrF2jsrV51qipraBdqK6trdGyZJ6omai8pbGNoaumpA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
