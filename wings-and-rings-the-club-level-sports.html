With so many options available, choosing the right franchise can be overwhelming. However, a few franchises stand out from the crowd, due to their excellent reputation, unique concept and strong support system for franchisees. One of these franchises is <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Wings and Rings,</a></strong> led by <strong>Nader Masadeh,</strong> the brand’s <strong>President and CEO (and co-owner)</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>With its global reach, emphasis on superior service and commitment to providing a fun and welcoming atmosphere, Wings and Rings is one of the top franchises to invest in for 2023.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Connecting People Over Sports</h2><p>Wings and Rings is a global restaurant chain established in 1984 with a simple vision: to bring people together over sports. With 87 locations, in the U.S., Mexico, Europe and the Middle East, , the restaurants offer a unique club-level sports experience. Customers can enjoy delicious food and drinks and watch their favorite sports games in a welcoming and fun environment. The Company delivers a Club-Level Sports Restaurant and Bar experience with My Place Service, Club-Level Ambiance&nbsp; and Craveworthy Wings and Rings, and so much more on the diverse menu of offerings.</p><p>The Company values teamwork, positively impacting others, and having fun. The restaurant aims to set itself apart with this approach to great food and family-style guest service.&nbsp; This also applies to team members and the community.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Overcoming Initial Challenges&nbsp;</h3><p>Wings and Rings, previously known as Buffalo Wings and Rings, started as a small restaurant chain with a few locations in Greater Cincinnati. One of the restaurant’s primary challenges was building brand awareness as an emerging brand. However, as word got out, the restaurant chain began to grow around the Midwest and South, and it continues to expand today throughout the U.S., Mexico, Europe and the Middle East. Another challenge that the Company faced was confusion with another large buffalo wing franchise. This confusion led to removing the word “Buffalo” from its name. Despite this challenge, the restaurant chain continues to thrive..</p><p>Wings and Rings focused on building brand awareness through advertising and word-of-mouth marketing to overcome these initial challenges. The restaurant chain also leveraged social media platforms to connect with customers and promote its unique brand experience.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Keys to Success and Franchising</h3><p>Wings and Rings owes its long-standing success to its focus on people and being a great place for human connections. The restaurant believes in the Spirit of Continuous Improvement, meaning never settling and continuously striving to evolve and improve its business.</p><p>The Company has succeeded by taking a paradigm-shifting approach in an underwhelming food segment – sports bars and restaurants – by focusing on great food, warm design elements, fun, and personalized service. The restaurant has also kept up with technology and innovation, using A.I. and robotics in its kitchen, accepting Bitcoin for franchise fees, creating a new website, App and point-of-sale system, and installing valet pick-up lanes or dedicated areas inside their restaurants.</p><p>Service and evolution are key to Wings and Rings’ success, and the restaurant began franchising in 2005 when Nader acquired the restaurant. With a loyal fan base, delicious food, and a fun business model, it was only natural for the restaurant to expand through franchising.&nbsp; However, it is important to adapt to changing wants and needs of the Company guests.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Wings and Rings Services.</h3><p>Wings and Rings focuses on a chef-driven menu with various crave-worthy items, including chicken wings, onion rings, chicken tenders, burgers, salads and more, including a wide range of sauces. The <a href=#>restaurant also offers</a> its personalized “My Place Service,” making customers feel welcomed and at home in their restaurants.&nbsp; They strive to be friendly, accurate, fast and consistent, while making you feel at home.</p><p>Wings and Rings also stays informed via industry organizations like the International Franchise Association and the National Restaurant Association to stay updated with the evolving franchising and restaurant sectors. The restaurant’s leadership team has extensive experience with multiple, leading franchise brands, which also provides a breadth of understanding and a passion for Excellence.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>&nbsp;Innovating with Technology</h2><p>Wings and Rings recently introduced several technological advancements to enhance its customer experience. The restaurant has redesigned its model with on- and off-premise occasions in mind, making it easier for customers to get their favorite food items. It has also developed a new App, POS, and website functionality to streamline ordering. Customers can place their orders using the app and they have an optional order-and-pay-at-the-table feature. This has significantly reduced wait times and improved overall efficiency.</p><p>But that’s not all. The Company is also testing robotics and A.I to further enhance its operations. Automating certain tasks can increase efficiency and consistency. This innovation is just the beginning, as they have more exciting plans in the pipeline. In addition to all this, Wings and Rings has also started accepting Bitcoin for franchise fees. This shows that the restaurant is keeping up with the times and embracing the growing cryptocurrency trend.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Collaborating for Growth</h3><p>Wings and Rings takes a collaborative approach to decision-making when improving its products and services. It works closely with its franchisees, seeking feedback and ideas to help guide their strategic decisions. Wings and Rings holds weekly calls with all franchisees, quarterly webcasts, and an annual convention to facilitate this collaboration. It also has a Franchise Advisory Council, which provides a forum for franchisees to share their thoughts and opinions.</p><p>This feedback is critical in helping the Company’ operations, development, marketing, R&D, and leadership teams make informed decisions. The restaurant’s seasoned leadership team is dedicated to considering matters from the franchisee and franchisor perspectives and making strategic decisions based on that insight. Rather than trying to do everything, Wings and Rings focuses on doing fewer things with more depth and quality. This approach allows it to deliver excellent products and services to its customers while supporting its franchisees’ growth and success.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Take on Franchise Leadership</h3><p>Nader oversees the leadership team responsible for the various business areas, including Operations, Development, Finance, Marketing, I.T. and HR. Each leadership team member is accountable for their department, as well as the commitment to strategically rise above each department and to be “on” the business, not “in” the business. This requires objectivity and the ability to think like both a Board Member and a Department Head, balancing the needs of the business as a whole with the needs of each department.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Nader, franchise leadership has remained consistent in its core aspects. However, the approach to executing and measuring these aspects has evolved significantly. Effective communication, dedication to franchise relationships, solid business and franchise-support models, focus, accountability and continuous improvement have always been crucial elements of franchise leadership. But with the advancements in technology and changes in communication norms, there is now a need for speed in effective communication.</p><p>Additionally, the evolution required to stay competitive in any business segment is a key consideration. Franchise leadership now places an equal focus on strategy and execution to ensure the franchise’s continued growth and success.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Accomplished Executives at Wings and Rings</h3><p>Wings and Rings has accomplished executives with diverse backgrounds.
