Serving as a source of both fashion and relationship envy, the shirt featured the actor’s promotional photo from Greta Gerwig’s highly-anticipated Barbie film (out July 21) in which he plays everyone’s favorite bare-chested, blonde-headed himbo, Ken. Eva paired the heather white tee, which aptly read “Barbie 2023 Ryan Gosling as Ken,” with a pair of slouchy, ankle-cuffed blue jeans, and she accessorized only with a smattering of gold rings.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Instagram/eva mendes</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for glam, the actress opted to wear her auburn hair down in soft waves with a side part, and she finished the look with a subtle cat-eye liner and a bright pink lip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Got that real big Kenergy.

I didn't know Ken from within. I doubted my Kenergy. I didn't see it,” he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>said</a> during a Barbie panel before adding that Gerwig and his co-star Margot Robbie eventually “conjured” the Ken out of him.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was living my life, and the next thing I knew, I was bleaching my hair and shaving my legs and rollerblading on Venice Beach,” he joked.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xK%2BYZqWVo7Gmv4yknKdlpGLAqbXRrWSrsZGjeqi70qWgp59dnru0wMCgqZqlXWyBeoSVcmk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
