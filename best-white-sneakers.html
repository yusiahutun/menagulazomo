Whether you're going for a timeless sneaker style or something a little more modern — such as a chunky sole or boot-like high-top — or a pair of retro kicks, many will agree that they are the most versatile shoe style around.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>White sneakers are easy to style</a> and are one of those staple pieces that truly stand the test of time. "A pair of white sneakers is just like a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>white t-shirt</a> — a foundational piece in your wardrobe that is always on trend and always perfectly functional," Kathleen Sullivan, Senior Director of Marketing at Keds confirms. And, much like a white t-shirt, there are tons of white sneakers to choose from, which can cause a bit of overwhelm if you're looking for the best of the best. But, alas, that's where we come in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">From classics to cult favorites and everything in between, we meticulously researched the best white sneakers, keeping design, material, sizing, comfort, and longevity in mind. When it came down to it, nothing beat the all-time classic <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Nike Air Force 1</a>. The shoe checks off all our boxes and will still remain in style for well over a decade — after all, they’ve been around for longer than that already.

First introduced as basketball shoes, the iconic sneaker quickly gained popularity through hip-hop culture, then it transitioned to a widely-accepted mainstream fashion staple. Even though they’re slightly chunky with a generous platform and padded collars, the shoe still looks fresh. And the soft, springy cushioning makes them ideal for all-day comfort, while the holes at the top keep your feet well-ventilated. Considering that the style also pairs well with just about anything, it might be tempting to wear them day after day again. However, according to the reviews, the shoes are not durable enough to maintain their pristine condition after much wear. Senior commerce editor Chloe Anello has had hers for six years, though, and admits that while they certainly look beat up — the inner lining even has a hole in the back — she notes that the shoes stayed intact where it counts, like the sole and stitching. They are mostly composed of leather, too, which will mold and bend with time, so take good care of them when they’re in your possession.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather, foam midsole <strong>| Fit: </strong>True to size <strong>| Size range:&nbsp; </strong>5 - 12</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jhett Thompson</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-common-projects-original-achilles-leather-sneakers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Common Projects Original Achilles Sneakers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Common Projects Original Achilles Leather Sneakers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/qW679FAllHhCRBltFw6eRRmA6Yk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/common-projects-original-achilles-leather-sneakers-c1da559d8f9342c2958c3bce76923abf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>The sleek, minimalist design is crafted from soft Italian leather, making them both stylish and comfortable.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Common Projects white sneakers have become somewhat of a staple in recent years as well, with fashionable personalities wearing them frequently. The sleek leather design, crafted by the leaders in leather themselves (the Italians, if it wasn’t clear), comes with minimal detailing. Aside from the signature serial code stamped on the side of the heel, the silhouette remains clean, which gives you the opportunity to wear these loafers’ counterparts easily to work as well. But style isn’t the only aspect that gave these shoes their fame – the Achilles leather sneakers are known to be soft and comfortable, fitting like a glove from day one. However, like many European shoe brands, these are not offered in half sizes. The brand recommends sizing up if you typically fall in between sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather <strong>| Fit: </strong>True to size<strong> | Size range: </strong>4 - 12</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-vans-canvas-old-skool></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vans Canvas Old Skool</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vans Canvas Old Skool" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bUtUq6iiQMAMGkUH2ew59_nPaTk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign31-8e86bfed1f7245babfbe44e6ae6c76e8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Vans</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s a reason why the iconic design, which has been around since the 70s, has a large celebrity following (everyone from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Emily Ratajkowski</a> to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Zendaya</a> to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Kim Kardashian</a> has been seen rocking them); they simply never go out of style. Stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nocaes>Lindsay Flores</a> considers Vans to be her “favorite everyday sneaker” that she “wears all the time. They’re such a timeless classic sneaker that everyone simply loves,” she adds. Despite its durability typically associated with a high cost, the classic Canvas Old Skool style comes at an affordable price, so its versatility and timeless appeal can be accessed by all. And we really do mean “by all” — Vans offers a wide size range, from a size 5 to 17.5. That being said, though, some complain that these sneakers run a bit narrow at first. Exercise some patience, and with enough time and wear, they will expand and mold around your feet. Trust us, these will be plenty comfortable thanks to the cushioned ankle and flexible body.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cotton <strong>| Fit: </strong>True to size <strong>| Size range: </strong>5 - 17.5</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jhett Thompson</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-work-banana-republic-knit-sneaker></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Work</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Banana Republic Knit Sneaker</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Banana Republic Knit Sneaker" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/DDWsHH_k748f4qvEU02_Sn4Ki5c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/banana-republic-knit-sneaker-16cf84a1cf004e8b901fde43e658da21.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Banana Republic</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In order to pick the best white sneakers for work, we considered the shoe’s durability, comfort, and of course, appeal. Whether you’re spending over eight hours on your feet or visiting the office every day (our condolences if you are), these knit sneakers allow for ample movement through the stretchy knit top, support on your soles through the cushioned footbed, and a sleek addition to your office attire. The lace front allows you to adjust for snugness, and the loop on the back makes it easy to slip on and off. The bottom of the shoe is made of thermoplastic rubber, which compared to regular rubber, has better slip resistance and higher impact resistance. If you expect to do a lot of walking, these will endure more and thereby last you longer. Across the reviews, everyone seems to agree that these provide tons of comfort. If you have wide feet, you’ll be happy to learn that these run a little larger as well. Everyone else, it might make sense to size down a half-size.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyurethane, polyester, thermoplastic rubber, leather flocking <strong>| Fit: </strong>Runs big<strong> | Size range: </strong>6 - 10</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-comfortable-new-balance-550-white-sneakers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Comfortable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>New Balance 550 White Sneakers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="New Balance 550 White Sneakers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/HxbcOJiDVadchOb20AzfQxRFoaE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/new-balance-550-white-sneakers-ecd7c63fdd494ac6a1325807ba620b12.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>New Balance</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Across the team here at InStyle, almost every writer and editor owns a pair of New Balance sneakers. Their comfort and ease of style are undeniably an appeal. And influencer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Aarica Nichole</a> loves these shoes, as well, especially when going for a “statement sneaker.” As she explains, “They’re a great option to spice up a casual outfit or if you want to go for a more sporty street style look.” InStyle writer Bianca Kratky also finds them excellent for travel because she can wear them for long periods of time without feeling achy arches or cramped toes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Originally intended for basketball, these sneakers have a sturdy, supportive leather upper and rubber sole while cushioning protects the ankle. Rather than a sleek design, these ones come with the classic NB logo, textured seams across the shoe, and an asymmetrical lining across the toes. Because of the unisex sizing and the sudden popularity over the past few years, it might be a bit difficult to get your hands on them for a time being, especially in smaller sizes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather, rubber<strong> | Fit: </strong>True to size <strong>| Size range: </strong>5.5 - 18.5</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-adidas-primegreen-stan-smith-sneaker></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Adidas Stan Smith Sneaker</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Adidas Primegreen Stan Smith Sneaker" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/vh046LwEdoslg9ab_VSeRniRU6w=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/adidas-primegreen-stan-smith-sneaker-59623c073e6247c18264dfa4c655400a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Adidas Stan Smith sneakers swooped through the nation (nay, the world) over the past few years at an impressive rate. As a staple white sneaker for women and men of all ages, its versatility, quality, sustainability, and color accent on the back of the shoe played a large role in its rise to popularity. Adidas crafted the shoe in an effort to reduce plastic waste, with the upper portion being made of 50 percent Primegreen recycled materials. While the green logo and back is its most popular style (and symbolize its eco-efforts) the shoe is also offered in all-white, dark blue, gold, and mint green.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, the shoes are also wildly comfortable. With a cushioned insole (that’s removable, should you want to swap it for something else), a snug lace-up, and a flexible upper, you’ll find your feet well-supported. The brand does note that these run large, however, so size down for a perfect fit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Synthetic rubber, Primegreen recycled materials, <strong>| Fit: </strong>Runs big <strong>| Size range: </strong>5 - 11</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-platform-steve-madden-rockaway-white-sneakers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Platform</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Steve Madden White Sneakers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Steve Madden Rockaway White Sneakers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/opvAayRT2olwUo1YRrL1wgpTnu4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/steve-madden--rockaway-white-sneakers-22a867f94a7d4bc2a266fed67e587b34.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Steve Madden</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Need a little height without the heel? These two-inch platform sneakers will grant you just that. The Steve Madden Rockaway sneakers have been making their rounds on social media — and for good reason. A wildly enthusiastic group of reviewers will confirm that despite the lift, they’re actually extremely comfortable. By intersecting perfectly between style, comfort, and height, they have been the ideal shoe for travelers to spend their touristy strolls in, according to the reviews (we’re talking consecutive days around Paris, Vienna, Madrid, and more). Although the brand doesn’t actually list what they’re made from exactly, they do confirm it’s a synthetic material, which most likely means plastic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, that might mean they’re easy to clean, which might be a selling point for those who plan to wear them regularly. Kratky has a variety of wide-leg pants that reach the floor, and finds platform sneakers, like these to be the ideal shoe to casually add a little height for the pants without needing to turn to heels. However, with all platform shoes, there is the need to be careful not to twist your ankles. Since these are low-tops, you won’t have any support around them either.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Vegan leather <strong>| Fit: </strong>True to size <strong>| Size range: </strong>5 - 11</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sporty-nike-air-max-sc></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Sporty</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nike Air Max SC</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nike Air Max SC" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5sTpx8BE15TreagbBg2Vv2EnfGM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nike-air-max-sc-635b0a2d501649e6a6f1ce49050139b0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nike</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the Nike Air Force 1s get most of the attention, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kratky</a> personally adores the Air Max shoes — she stayed loyal to her pair even after her dog chewed it up quite a bit.&nbsp; She can’t find anything else that compares to the sporty aesthetic and comfort. The visible air cushioning on the heels makes each step feel softened — walking with these is not unlike walking on air, hence the name. Kratky also appreciates that the sole curves with the natural arch of the foot, which keeps her feet from feeling any strains, and the mesh panels, leather construction, and padded lining offers ample support. These details also make the shoe feel more durable — Kratky has worn hers on hikes, to the gym, and running errands, and she has yet to notice any major signs of wear and tear. Just know that the mesh paneling will be difficult to keep clean, so perhaps the hiking trails should be avoided.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather, foam <strong>| Fit: </strong>True to size<strong> | Size range: </strong>5 - 12</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-slip-on-vagabond-judy-sneakers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Slip-On</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vagabond Judy Sneakers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vagabond Judy Sneakers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/B1BFQ3-4k7E8k5Ntkq-L_LrAv7g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vagabond-judy-sneakers-c0758933a1d24bbaaf1ca5dfad8844f9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Vagabond</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When we think of slip-ons, we often think of styles made from canvas. These ones from Vagabond stand out with their slick leather uppers and platform sole, which gives them a more versatile feel for the typically casual slip-on style. They can easily be dressed up or down, adding a clean and polished feel to any outfit. On top of bringing something new to the slip-on style, one of our favorite aspects of these sneakers are the padded collars. Slip-ons traditionally take some time to break in and adding a sturdier fabrication like leather to the mix can drag out the process. But, with the extra cushioning, they have a layer of comfort that many slip-ons don't have. However, as another European brand, these shoes don’t come in half sizes. Considering that leather can stretch and mold into your foot, we recommend sizing down and breaking the shoe in with time.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather<strong>| Fit: </strong>True to size <strong>| Size range: </strong>35-42</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-high-top-converse-chuck-taylor-all-star-sneakers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best High Top</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Converse Chuck Taylor</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Sneakers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/x44fANTdakUQno42HosEA91vigA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/converse-mens-chuck-taylor-all-star-sneakers-c177de1684e940dc8780b2d9f5308b92.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We cannot recall a time when <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Converse Chuck Taylors</a> weren’t in.

The white comes in two versions — one with the signature red and blue piping, and one monochrome, all-white shoe, where even the logo is pure white. While the first might be more popular among shoppers, the latter makes for a more versatile piece to style. That being said, the lightweight canvas won’t give you any warmth during the winter, making these a strictly spring-to-fall shoe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>N/A <strong>| Fit: </strong>True to size<strong> | Size range: </strong>5 - 19, regular, wide</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sustainable-veja-esplar-sneakers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Sustainable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Veja Esplar</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Veja Esplar Sneakers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/fYsJreE1HVBnnhaGnY_owcyerW0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign35-131a579d30b34912949c064a6943ffc7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Net-a-Porter</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since its launch in 2005, Veja quickly rose in popularity thanks to its sleek design, comfortable shoes, and most importantly, ethical business practices. Everything from the organic cotton used in the canvas and laces, the amazonian rubber used in the soles, and the people involved in the creation, Veja moves with sustainability as their northern star. That’s not to say the brand is vegan, however. The shoes linked here have a calf leather top and suede leather logo. Although if you do prefer a non-animal product, they do have a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">vegan collection</a> on their site as well.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kratky</a> was given the opportunity to try the pair linked here, thanks to the team at Veja, and was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable they are. Despite there not being much arch support, the rest of the shoe comfortably hugs the foot. There’s no doubt that it looks extremely chic, but they can also surprisingly withstand the rain and wind, as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Kratky</a> found out whilst walking into a bit of a surprise storm. The smooth leather was easy to clean with a single swipe, making it a breeze to keep them white for a long period of time.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Rubber, leather, organic cotton<strong> | Fit: </strong>True to size<strong> | Size range: </strong>5 - 12</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tennis-everlane-releather-court-sneakers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tennis</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane Court Sneakers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Everlane ReLeather Court Sneakers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/vz3qrxFsYfQljms1KtPBwlrGwdw=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/everlane-releather-court-sneakers-5833a3834af24f7a8737ad916f9be72c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Everlane</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These court sneakers are similar to the Veja sneakers in design, but with a brighter white and a higher platform. And true to Everlane’s commitment to sustainability, they’re crafted with 50 percent recycled leather and 50 percent non-leather substances, a material Everlane calls “ReLeather”. They are long-lasting, give leather scraps another life, and require less water to produce. The shoe itself feels comfortable, according to the reviews, although those with wider feet complain that the narrow toe box makes their feet hurt after some time. Some have pointed out that they needed to size down, while others recommend sizing up, which makes finding the right fit slightly confusing. Once you do, however, you will enjoy how lightweight and relaxed they feel. They don’t require much time to break in and can be worn on long walks right out of the box.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Recycled leather, miscellaneous scraps<strong>| Fit: </strong>Varies<strong> | Size range: </strong>5 - 12</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-leather-vince-gabi-leather-low-top-sneaker></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Leather</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vince Low Top Sneaker</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vince Gabi Leather Low Top Sneaker" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/UIIa6ZZDndDKm8i9pyDQiZ6dWBc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vince-gabi-leather-low-top-sneaker-57889c092c7740d3b57df2bae6d8821d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Saks Fifth Avenune</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Featuring smooth leather both on the upper and lining of the shoe, the Vince Gabi sneakers provide a sleek, all-white addition to any outfit. Aside from the discreet logo stamped on the side, the shoe has minimal design elements, which keeps them looking slick and understated. Meanwhile, the 1.75-inch rubber platform helps give you a little elevation, making this ideal for a sophisticated getup. While reviewers all agree that the elegant shoe looks and feels luxurious with a supple leather outer that molds to your feet over time, they also all collectively point out that they run too big, some even opting for one full size smaller. The brand itself recommends sizing a half size down, so we definitely suggest following this advice.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather, rubber<strong> | Fit: </strong>Runs large<strong> | Size range: 5 - 11</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-all-white-thursday-boot-company-premier-low-top></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best All White</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Thursday Boot Company Premier Low Top</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Thursday Boot Company Premier Low Top" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/eJ3sXUCCGD0AZClljUhwcbvndWU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/thursday-boot-company-premier-low-top-f2bc8c7c24c64b6ab4237e63a39dfb06.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Thursday Boot Company</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sure, a lot of the shoes on this list are pure white, like the Converse High-Tops, for example, but for something more versatile (and crisp, all-white), Kratky suggests going with InStyle writer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Eva Thomas</a>’s suggestion of these Thursday Boots sneakers. She says that these all-white sneakers “have gotten more wear than most of my shoes.” That’s because the shock-absorbant footbeds make walking in them a breeze, while a padded tongue and collar feel gentle around your ankles. The shoe features a leather upper, as well as a buttery soft leather interior. “The streamlined silhouette pairs well with everything, even fancier trousers,” raves Thomas. The near-seamless design gives them an elegant appeal, which is why wearing them to the office, as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Thomas</a> does, feels perfectly appropriate. She did call out that they’re a bit narrow fresh out of the box, but the leather eventually stretched and molds to your foot over time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather<strong> | Fit: | Size range: </strong>5 - 12</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-canvas-cariuma-naioca-canvas-sneakers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Canvas</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cariuma Naioca Canvas Sneakers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cariuma Naioca Canvas Sneakers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/uWDCk8yhHStPk8PKqUy0r85wyXY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Cariuma-OCA-Low-Canvas-Sneakers-07c7875888c64ccdb65cee66d5d3bcec.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Cariuma</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">InStyle editors and celebrities alike rave about the comfort of Cariuma’s canvas sneakers. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Alexandra Daddario</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Helen Mirren</a>, and more have all been seen out and about in these sustainable, highly versatile sneakers that stand apart just a tad from the Nike and Adidas sneakers of the world.

Why not just skip the antics and go straight for an intentionally off-white sneaker? The Reebok Club C’s are another one of those trendy shoes that gained momentum recently, thanks to their laid-back style. They were designed after the classic 80s tennis court shoe, and therefore feature a low-to-the-ground platform, low top cut, and a durable rubber sole. For a slightly customized fit, the insole can be removed and swapped, if you have specific sole needs (like an arched foot).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the green-detailed shoe is the most popular, you can find it in turquoise, light blue, dark blue, and red, too.

This texture, typically reserved for cozy winter boots, is now available as everyday walking shoes as well, making it possible for you to style white sneakers in the winter. Merino wool (which is finer and therefore softer than your usual wool), retains heat and wicks away moisture better than most other materials. Not to mention, it's also naturally odor resistant and breathable — a definite perk when it comes to sneakers. The only con that comes with such textures is that they are difficult to clean. The brand does provide cleaning instructions (remove insoles and machine wash in a delicates bag), but it’s likely the texture will change with time after a few too many washes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Merino wool<strong>| Fit: </strong>True to size<strong> | Size range: </strong>5 - 11</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Comfort</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sneakers are designed with comfort in mind — and there is nothing more uncomfortable than a shoe that doesn't fit. When shopping for a pair of white sneakers, make sure to follow the sizing charts and measure your soles to find your perfect match. Reading customer reviews can also help to determine if they run true-to-size. Also, keep in mind whether you have flat or curved feet. Most shoes, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Veja Esplar Suede Trimmed Leather Sneakers</a><strong>,</strong> have flat soles, which can be uncomfortable for those with an arched foot. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Nike Air Max SC</a> on the other hand mildly curves along your feet to provide that gentle support. Other shoes give you the option to remove the sole and swap it for something else. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Reebok Club C 85 Vintage Shoes</a> for example allows you to do just that, and you can insert your own <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">insole</a> for better support.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The fabrication of a shoe is also important, especially if you have a specific use in mind. For example, If you're looking for a pair of white sneakers to wear to the office, a shoe made of leather, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Everlane ReLeather Court Sneakers</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Vince Gabi Leather Low Top Sneaker</a>, and the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Thursday Boots&nbsp; Premier Low Top Sneakers</a>, is a great choice as it has an elevated feel that pairs well with smart business attire.

You might also find small colored detailings, like logos and linings, made of the brand’s signature colors. For a true-white sneaker, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Thursday Boots Premier Low Top Sneaker</a> provides that clean and sleek look.

However, the additional colors might make it more difficult to pair with everything, the way an all-white sneaker would.

For canvas sneakers, Sean McDowell, Vice President of Design and Product Development at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">Sperry</a>, says to reach for a little bleach. "I use a spray bottle mixed with water and bleach," he explains. For this process, you'll want to remove the laces and then use a strong bristled brush "to get in all of the recesses of the canvas and rubber sidewalls," McDowell notes. Once you've scrubbed them clean, place them in the sun for a few hours to dry and brighten them up. With that said, bleach is a harsh chemical, so it's best to use this method on white canvas sneakers that are inexpensive. For more expensive pairs, it's best to protect them ahead of time with a stain-resistant coating and spot clean as needed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To clean white leather sneakers, McDowell recommends using a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and baking soda. "I use an old toothbrush to get in all the nooks and crannies," he explains. "It's gentler than bleach and, with smooth leather, you don't need to go as deep as canvas," he adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re not in the mood to cook up a science project in the kitchen, however, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Nichole</a> recommends the brand <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Jason Mark</a>, which she uses to clean all her white sneakers.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As far as laces are concerned, you can easily remove them from your sneakers and toss them in the wash with your whites for a fresh scrub. And, if they get to a point where they are too far gone, purchasing a new pair of shoelaces is an inexpensive and quick way to freshen up your soles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you are concerned about keeping white sneakers squeaky clean, McDowell says to also consider dipping your toes into (literally) the off-white or tofu-colored sneaker trend. "It gives a more vintage look and is a little easier to maintain."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What can you wear white sneakers with?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The best part about these classic kicks? "You can really wear them with anything," says Sullivan. "A crisp white sneaker can complement a classic outfit or be a neutral piece for a more fashion-forward look," she adds. If you’re going for a casual everyday look, opt for something like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Reebok Club C 85 Vintage Shoes</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Cariuma Off-White Canvas Sneakers</a>, or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Adidas Stan Smith Sneakers</a>, which <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nocaes>Flores</a> would style with “straight fit jeans, fitted tees, and a blazer”.

"With more and more people heading back into the office but not wanting to sacrifice the comfort of working from home, a pair of white sneakers can instantly bring that feel while still looking professional," she adds. Additionally, McDowell notes that a white leather sneaker is a great choice for office attire, as it adds a touch of personality while still looking professional and buttoned up.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bianca Kratky</a> is a commerce writer at InStyle, with two years of experience covering fashion, beauty, and lifestyle products. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Jessie Quinn</a> is a contributing writer, whose work can be found on InStyle, Birdie, Brides, and more.
