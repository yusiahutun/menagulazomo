The Englishwoman met the famous actor at a hotel in London where she worked in public relations in 1976. At the time they met, there was a 47-year age gap between them.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/grranrris.jpg><p>However, even that could not stop the love that bloomed between them when they met. Harris was smitten.&nbsp;</p><p>She said: “His mind always remained young because he was alive and interested in everything. And he was even funnier than he was in films. He had a twinkle in his eyes.”</p><p>The relationship suffered a bit when Cary questioned Harris’s motives for loving him. Luckily, she seemed to understand what he needed intuitively.&nbsp;</p><p>She said about that time: “I felt that I had to prove that I was not there for the wrong reasons. Once he realized how much I loved him, I could not have ever wished for a more loving husband.”</p><p>Harris remained behind Cary until he died from a sudden stroke in 1986. In his will, he split his fortune between his daughter and Harris, the two women he cherished above others for the rest of his life.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Cary_Grants_Only_Daughter></span>Who Is Cary Grant’s Only Daughter?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Cary Grant’s only daughter is Jennifer Grant. According to Harris, she is a product of his marriage to his fourth wife, bringing the actor “great love.”</p><p>Harris <a href=#>told</a> Closer: “I think the birth of Jennifer brought him great love, and I think the relationship we had brought him peace. Most people who truly knew him commented that he was much more at ease and happier in the later part of his life.”</p><p>Cary welcomed his only child and daughter with his fourth wife, Dyan Cannon, and Jennifer recalls he was a dedicated parent.&nbsp;An event that showcased his dedication happened during Halloween. To celebrate the special day, a young Jennifer rang the doorbell of an unfamiliar house, and her father answered the door.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/grant.jpg><p>The Hollywood icon had rented a home in the area where his daughter would be trick-or-treating so that he could see her.&nbsp;</p><p>Jennifer recalls the time. She said, “I just ran up, got the candy, hugged him, and left. I was embarrassed, I think, by the extent of his love and devotion to me.”</p><p>Cary eventually retired from acting to focus on being a father to Jennifer. It was a great decision because he finally found happiness and fulfillment.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cary_Grants_Other_Spouses></span>Cary Grant’s Other Spouses&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The first woman who became Cary Grant’s spouse was Virginia Cherill, an actress. They married in 1934, but their marriage lasted less than a year.&nbsp;By March 1935, Cherill filed for divorce, claiming that Cary was a heavy drinker and abusive toward her.&nbsp;</p><p>His second wife was Barbara Hutton, Woolworths’ heiress. They tied the knot in 1943, but their union followed his first path.&nbsp;He met her at a party, and within the year, they were married.</p><p>At first, it was all fun and games, but things changed over the years.&nbsp;When they divorced in 1945, Hutton said he wasn’t interested in “anything but his career.” Betsy Drake became Cary Grant’s third spouse from 1949 until 1962.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/carry.jpg><p>The pair met on board the Queen Mary ship while returning from England. They split when the actor started having an affair with actress Sophia Loren.&nbsp;</p><p>Drake reportedly <a href=#>introduced</a> him to LSD, and he kept taking it well into his fourth marriage. His marriage to his fourth spouse ended because of his controlling ways and insecurities.&nbsp;</p><p>Cary has passed on now, but his legacy remains, and those he left behind still carry memories they made with him in their hearts.&nbsp;</p><p>Other stars like Cary Grant, who married people younger than them, include George Clooney and Amal Clooney, <a href=#>Pierce Brosnan</a> and Keely Shaye Smith, Princess Charlene and Prince Albert, and Elton John and David Furnish.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jLCYrGWTlr%2B6ecarmKeso2LAsbvUrJxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
