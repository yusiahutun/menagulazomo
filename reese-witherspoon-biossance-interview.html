"I was in my hometown Sephora and was looking at the Biossance products. It has such great reviews, and somebody mentioned it to me so I bought a bunch. I just started using them. And I found them so effective, completely luxurious, unlike any other clean product I've ever used. And I was just hooked."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">BAZAAR.com caught up with Witherspoon after a recent Biossance event to chat about her skin journey, how she unwinds at the end of a long day, and which of her iconic characters share her skin care routine.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What has your skin journey been like the last few years, and what are your concerns now?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My skin texture has changed a little bit—it's a little bit drier. I definitely struggle with brown spots, I think from pregnancy, and so I'm looking for products that are really effective for dark-spot treatment. Especially in the summer, they get darker since they come up with heat. But you know, moisturizing, making sure the texture is very smooth, that's really important for the base under the makeup, because the cameras now are so HD and there's nowhere to hide.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What are two or three things you think have contributed to how great your skin looks now. Is it a product, a lifestyle factor, or both?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I do think it all goes together—you know, getting enough sleep, eating well. I eat well the majority of the week, so I think that has a lot to do with it. One day a week, I get my cheat day, where I eat as much cake and pizza as I want, but I try to be pretty healthy the rest of the time. Exercise is a big piece and drinking a lot of water. I try not to drink too much coffee, but sometimes, I drink too much coffee. But then, you know, as far as skin care is concerned, just really making sure I'm cleaning and washing my face twice a day, particularly on heavy-makeup days, and moisturizing and adding all the serums, because they really do make a big difference.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>You mentioned earlier that you have really strict morning and nighttime skin care routines now.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I didn't realize how strict it was. I have a whole process. Once I was like, "Oh, that's a solid 13 minutes."</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>That's nothing compared to beauty editors. You're in good company here. What's one piece of skin care advice that you're passing down to your kids?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Well, Ava's so into beauty. She just has always loved it, even as a little girl. She watched YouTube videos, and she can do her own makeup so beautifully. So it's really fun to watch her do it. She teaches me a lot of stuff. I definitely get a lot of tips from her. She has a different skin type than me, though, so she likes completely different products.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I believe just the importance of taking off your makeup every night, moisturizing your skin, and sunscreen! It really accumulates—what you do to your skin when you're 18 shows up on your face when you're 40.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Y</strong><strong>ou've played so many iconic characters over the years. Which one do you think would have the skin care routine closest to your own?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I mean, Elle Woods, probably. Or Madeline Martha Mackenzie from Big Little Lies. She invests a lot in skincare, and is very passionate about the environment as well. I feel like Madeline probably knows the owner of Biossance and maybe has some stock.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>How do you unwind after a long day other than your nighttime skin care routine? Do you read before bed?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My sweats go on the minute I come home. Bra off, sweats on. I usually read about 30 minutes to an hour every night, and that just relaxes me. I listen to, like, relaxing music that really sets the mood for bed. It's either, like, scrolling through TikTok or reading a book, and I find reading a book much more beneficial for my mental health. Reading really is like a relaxation technique for me. It takes me to another place. I'm thinking about these characters. I get very immersed in their world. And everything else kind of fades away.</p><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Biossance Glow On, Dew Good Set Shop Reese's Favorites</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$35 at Sephora for Shop Reese's Favorites" data-href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=74968X1524972&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP480278" data-product-url="https://go.skimresources.com?id=74968X1524972&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP480278" data-affiliate=false data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$35 at Sephora" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://go.skimresources.com?id=74968X1524972&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP480278" data-vars-ga-product-brand="Biossance Glow On, Dew Good Set" data-vars-ga-product-id=e9ec5cb0-ba4f-4fac-8145-bdacdf94682b data-vars-ga-product-price=$35.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=2e34a744-a2a8-46c3-b06e-7cc818460291 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category="Wall Décor" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Shop Reese's Favorites" title="Shop Reese's Favorites" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1639761163-21_1102_CAM_PDP_P4057_HOLPhase2_ReeseGlowOnDewGoodSet_580x@2x.jpg width=1160 height=1160 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Biossance Glow On, Dew Good Set Shop Reese's Favorites</h2></p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a5b794e4-ba0e-4527-9e9d-e98142b9fbef_1526586861.jpg alt="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" title="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jenna Rosenstein is the Beauty Director at Harper's BAZAAR across both print and digital. While attending NYU, she held internships at Women’s Wear Daily, Bloomingdale’s, Harper’s BAZAAR, and Allure, the latter of which she parlayed into her first job as the Beauty Assistant. She left Allure three years later as the Senior Beauty Editor. She spent a few months at Refinery29 overseeing branded content in the same title, before finally landing back at BAZAAR to manage all beauty content. When she's not testing every lipstick known to mankind, getting zapped by new lasers, or interviewing experts and celebrities, you can find Rosenstein at home in New Jersey with her son, husband, and black cat named Maddie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqyjmaN6pK3Rnmaaa2hqf3mAmHJmq52VqLJuw8itn56qo6W8sLqMm6Coq6OWu6SxjKKlrZ2iq7amw44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
