However, May’s cosmic forecast gets intense quickly—as the planets are about to make some major moves.</span></p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/askawitch_question3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/newmoonintauruszodiac.gif?w=960&h=540&crop=1"><p><span>Taurus season’s slow-but-steady energy is especially helpful this month, as we’re in <a href=#>the midst of Mercury retrograde</a>, which can cause all sorts of mental mix-ups and misunderstandings. On May 1, the sun in Taurus will align with Mercury retrograde, forming what’s called a ‘Mercury cazimi.’ This conjunction could bring a moment of clarity amidst the current retrograde confusion, so take note of any spiritual downloads or clarifying insights. On the same day, power-hungry Pluto begins its annual retrograde, prompting us to reexamine the intense undercurrents of our lives over the next five months.</span></p><p><span>Speaking of intensity, the <a href=#>first lunar eclipse of 2023</a> rises on May 5 (we had <a href=#>a solar eclipse in April</a>, which kicked off eclipse season). This full moon eclipse takes place in Scorpio, and it’ll be the final eclipse to hit this razor-focused water sign until 2031. Look forward to a climactic conclusion to a story that’s been weaved in our lives for the past two years! Thanks to a lunar face-off with surprise-filled Uranus, this eclipse could serve up some unexpected endings and shocking twists, so it’s an important time to purge away the last of that expired emotional baggage that’s been weighing you down. Dig deep and excavate your spirit.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/november-horoscopes.png><p><span>Planetary energies </span><i><span>really</span></i><span> start shifting once the eclipse is out of the way: <a href=#>Love planet Venus</a> enters soft and sensitive Cancer on May 7, leaving behind the noncommittal flirtatiousness of <a href=# id=auto-tag_gemini data-tag=gemini>Gemini</a> in favor of more emotional security and comfort. One week later, on May 14, Mercury retrograde comes to an end, allowing our thoughts, conversations, and daily grinds to run much more smoothly. Rejoice! Then on May 16, abundant Jupiter enters opulent Taurus for the first time in more than a decade. This glittering year-long transit brings material blessings, an increased capacity for pleasure, a stronger desire for luxury and a renewed sense of faith in our values.</span></p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=0.72340425531915><p>The first <a href=# id=auto-tag_lunar-eclipse data-tag=lunar-eclipse>lunar eclipse</a> of 2023 rises on May 5.</p></figure><p><span>Venus, Mercury, and Jupiter aren’t the only planets making big moves mid-month. On May 20, <a href=#>go-getter Mars enters Leo</a>, which can boost our confidence levels, summon our leadership skills and fire up our libidos. It’s time to get moving! As Mars moves into this fire sign’s realm, it’ll be facing off with Pluto, turning up the heat on any power struggles. The desire to conquer our goals is greater than ever now—but we can’t let the intensity cause us to self-sabotage. If we channel this energy wisely instead of letting it explode, we can accomplish tremendous things.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/taurusseason2023.png><p><span>We’re closing out Taurus season with a lovely and grounding <a href=#>new moon in Taurus</a> on May 19. Positive lunar connections to bold Mars and strategic Pluto grant us plenty of stamina to pour into new projects and personal goals. Meanwhile, a lunar sextile with dreamy Neptune lends us a pair of rose-colored glasses—reminding us that so long as we think practically and work hard, we can make our most fantastical wishes come true.</span></p><p><span>Gemini season begins on May 21, lighting up our desire for social connection and putting our curious minds on hyperdrive. As the sun enters this clever air sign’s realm, it’ll make an easygoing sextile to Mars and a mystical trine to <a href=#>Pluto in Aquarius</a>. These positive solar aspects grant us motivation and higher energy levels, and give a rich depth to the many fresh ideas that are flowing. Throughout the final week of the month, the sun will be squaring off with stern and serious Saturn—bringing personal responsibilities to the forefront and forcing us to get real about our commitments and obligations.</span></p><p><span>Ready to dive into May’s astrological mix?
