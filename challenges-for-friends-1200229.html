Before engaging in any of these activities be careful to look out for each other's safety.</p><h3><strong>1. Ice Bucket Challenge</strong></h3><p>Starting with the classic! In this challenge, a <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","75 Fun Challenges for Friends to Bond and Create Memories","1200229","https://www.pinkvilla.com/tech/gaming/best-browser-games-in-2022-1177486","articlepage","/lifestyle/relationships/challenges-for-friends-1200229","bucket of ice cubes","Body_Hyperlink","lifestyle","relationships")'>bucket of ice cubes</a> and ice water is dumped over your friends' heads as you record their reactions while doing this challenge. Summers is a great time to do it, but make sure you have a spacious driveway or backyard to make a mess in.</p><h3><strong>2. Taste Testing</strong></h3><p>One of the challenges that foodie friends look forward to the most is this one. Ask your pals to recognize some strange foods they've ordered or prepared while wearing blinders. By asking them to sample and predict flavors in strange ice creams or by listing the ingredients in a prepared dish, you can change up this game. In this meal challenge for friends, the one who correctly answers the most questions wins!</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h3><strong>3. Marshmallow, Don’t Swallow</strong></h3><p><img alt="Person Holding S'mores" title="Person Holding S'mores" width=1280 height=1600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-11/1669200256_person-holding-smores.jpg></p><p>The name of this entertaining game gives away the rules, but they are as follows. Each companion crams as many marshmallows as they can into their mouths. No swallowing is allowed. Those who collect the most win.</p><h3><strong>4. Chopsticks Challenge</strong></h3><p>All you need are some friends who have never used chopsticks before, a deep dish, and some beans. Ask them to use the chopsticks to pick up the beans. You can play the game if your buddies are comfortable using chopsticks.</p><h3><strong>5. Alphabetic Themes Challenge</strong></h3><p>Choose a theme—say let's sports—and have each friend thinks of a sport, alphabetically. Like aerobics, basketball, and so on. Walk around the group until all of the alphabets have been covered.</p><h3><strong>6. Hot Pepper Poppers</strong></h3><p>You guessed it—a bunch of spicy peppers and buddies with runny noses and eyes. Whoever can eat the most will win. Don't push your buddies, though, if they have allergies.</p><h3><strong>7. Skribbl</strong></h3><p><img alt="Gray and Black Alien Drawing" title="Gray and Black Alien Drawing" width=1280 height=853 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-11/1669200287_gray-and-black-alien-drawing.jpg></p><p>This game is simple, enjoyable, and ideal for times when you can't have people over.

Another person must then flawlessly lip sync without turning to face the other. Make sure the lip-syncing person doesn't know the music or dialogue and that it is chosen at random.</p><h3><strong>9. A Mouthful of Cinnamon</strong></h3><p>If you sign up for this one, your pals will learn that eating a tablespoon of cinnamon is not enjoyable. It complements foods nicely but is not nearly something you would want to eat on its own. Don't forget to reiterate the prohibition from drinking anything between each round of the cinnamon challenge.</p><h3><strong>10. Going Instrumental</strong></h3><p><img alt="Delighted young ethnic female musician playing guitar on beach" title="Delighted young ethnic female musician playing guitar on beach" width=2755 height=3627 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-11/1669200314_delighted-young-ethnic-female-musician-playing-guitar-on-beach.jpg></p><p>Play a song's instrumental version and ask everyone to identify it.
