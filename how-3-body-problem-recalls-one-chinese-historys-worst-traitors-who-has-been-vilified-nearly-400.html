As a subject of the new regime, Wu persecuted loyalists of the fallen Ming dynasty, and even executed Yongli, the last pretender to the Ming throne.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In time, the central government reduced the powers of these regional princes, who responded by rebelling against the Qing dynasty. As a final hurrah, Wu declared himself emperor of the Wu-Zhou dynasty in 1678, but died seven months later of natural causes. Soon afterwards, the Qing government repossessed his princedom.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What motivated Wu to allow the Manchu army free passage into the Chinese heartland?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It could have been to save his family, who were being held by rebels in Beijing. He could have been trying to use the Manchu troops to defeat the rebels, with a plan to drive them back afterwards, but misjudged the strength of the troops.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/25/1bae6eac-ff9b-4a6f-9cb4-8f0ae4fc7dbe_acb907d4.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another question: after the Manchu invaders became China’s rulers, what made Wu hunt down the Ming loyalists and murder the remnants of the Ming imperial family?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Whatever his motivations were, Wu Sangui is still vilified as a traitor today. His very name is a byword for a turncoat in Chinese.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But why only him? What about the many other Han Chinese officials, soldiers and functionaries who served the Manchu before and after their occupation of China?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If these individuals were all Hanjian, what about the countless Chinese people who served in the British colonial government in Hong Kong? Surely, they couldn’t all be “traitors to the Chinese race”? Or were they?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOrJ%2BoqqRiv6atw6xmmqqknrCtsY5saW9oY2qFcLTOsGRsZZKksbp5z6umm6SVonqzscKao6WrXaS7pnnCoaCnnaOaeqm10q2mq7GjYsSwvtKtZK2qkZ7BsL7SZq6hp12drrR5wZ6cp2Wmnrmqssiem2amlZa%2FrcWMbWdp</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
