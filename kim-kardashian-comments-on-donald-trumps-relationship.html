No good?," Kimmel asked.</p><p>"Um listen, I don't think he likes me very much ... But I'm okay. I think he did amazing stuff with prison reform and let a lot of people out and signed an amazing bill, The First Step Act, and so that's what I'll focus on," Kardashian replied.</p><p>Trump and Kardashian worked on criminal justice reform issues together since 2018.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:c9622de0-7683-4f83-a434-51c0740e548c data-container-ref=toofab:article:66437942-297d-4b40-b696-e5f18110ef88 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5b/5by4/2024/04/07/5ba466a4636948e5a36e31c4099af78d_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kim Kardashian's American Horror Story Sex Scene Co-Star Dominic Burgess Opens Up About Experience</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>While the 43-year-old did not address why the pair are on the outs, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonathan Karl's book Tired Of Winning claimed Trump hung up</a> on the celebrity criminal justice advocate after she was lobbying the White House for more sentence commutations before his time was up as POTUS. When he allegedly asked for her help getting football stars to visit the White House, she felt he had "become too toxic."</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>, a phone call also occurred between the pair after Trump was out of office, when Kim reached out for an endorsement of her efforts to secure clemency for those serving time. "You voted for Biden and now you come asking me for a favor?" he allegedly said to her after calling her directly, before hanging up on her.</p><p>Kimmel then asked if Trump "ever let gas" in her presence, which the reality television star declined.</p><p>During her time with Kimmel, Kardashian also set a few rumors straight for her fans.</p><p>However, as Kimmel was reading the bizarre online facts that were found about Kardashian, she confirmed many happened to be true.</p><p>Kardashian confirmed that she blow dries her jewelry before putting it on, washes her feet before getting into bed, sleeps with her eyes slightly open, celebrated her 14th birthday at the Neverland Ranch, needs someone to take the Starbuck's sleeve off of her coffee because she hates the sound of cardboard, had her own work out DVD called Kim Kardashian: Fit In Your Jeans By Friday and knows how to change a tire.</p><p>The only rumors that were not true were that she started a church -- she says her mom did -- and that she has six toes.</p><p>One rumor that was not addressed by Kimmel is Kardashian's current backlash from Swifties following Taylor Swift's new song "thanK you aIMee." Many fans believe it is about the reality star and the ongoing feud involving the singer, Kardashian and her ex-husband Kanye West.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:47847d1c-42a9-4d71-b649-390fe77210a2 data-container-ref=toofab:article:66437942-297d-4b40-b696-e5f18110ef88 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/87/5by4/2024/04/19/8722f71e1fac47ea960192a26ab7392d_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h4 class=article-block__card-title>Everyone Taylor Swift Seemingly Alludes to in 'The Tortured Poets Department' And Why</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21ma2tfoLauecqaqZ2Zo522orqMnKampZWjwbR5zqdknaeelrmledOrrKaoo2K%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
