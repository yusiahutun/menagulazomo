It will be released on March 18 on Cobb’s Low Country Sound record label. The album also features songs from Chris and Morgane Stapleton, <a href=#>Miranda Lambert</a>, <a href=#>Brandy Clark</a>, John Paul White, the Black Crowes‘ Rich Robinson, <a href=#>Shooter Jennings</a>,<a href=#> Anderson East </a>and Holly Williams. Stapleton, Lambert and East have previously released their contributions to the album.</p><p>“Everybody has a great story, about their parents, their grandparents, brother, sister,” Cobb explains to <a href=#>Rolling Stone Country</a>. “Everybody has an intimate story and it was something that everybody could relate to. I wanted to have really talented artists custom write and do songs that mean a lot to them, and also just make the song that maybe they wouldn’t put on their record: the deep song, or the song that doesn’t fit in the queue or wouldn’t be a single. I wanted them to do the most honest song they could possibly do.”</p><p><strong>How Did the Zac Brown Band Originate?
