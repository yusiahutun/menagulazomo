Amazon now carries major fashion brands from <a href=#>Ganni</a> to <a href=#>LoveShackFancy</a>, but when I’m not in the mood to spend a ton of coin, I check out the reviews on more affordable pieces, which is how I ended up deciding to write this <a data-pmc-sp-product=7ef4df86ba866011d729c4b6f3ad827e href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Amazon Zesica dress","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"ZESICA Women&#39;s 2024 Summer Wrap V Neck Bohemian Floral Print Ruffle Swing A Line Beach Mini Dress,Red2,Large","price":"44.99","id":"B07PDB7TV9","category":"Dresses"},"id":1130664,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Amazon Zesica dress</a> review in the first place.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>The stock image of the <a href=# id=auto-tag_dress data-tag=dress>dress</a> on Amazon caught my eye, but it didn’t totally win me over. It wasn’t until I saw photos of reviewers looking so boho-chic that I knew I had to order it. Then, I ordered multiple other colors. Don’t judge me! Reading <a href=# rel=noopener>Amazon reviews</a> are definitely key when making a purchase from a brand you aren’t familiar with, and if you can get past the unnecessarily long product name and often low-quality product images, you can often find some serious gems.</p><p>That’s what happened when I stumbled upon the (long name alert)&nbsp;<span id=productTitle class=a-size-large><a data-pmc-sp-product=e2e793e789f00e1a6c2e364748b0ef46 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"ZESICA Women’s Summer Wrap V Neck Bohemian Floral Print Ruffle Swing A Line Beach Mini Dress","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"ZESICA Women&#39;s 2024 Summer Wrap V Neck Bohemian Floral Print Ruffle Swing A Line Beach Mini Dress,Red2,Large","price":"44.99","id":"B07PDB7TV9","category":"Dresses"},"id":1130664,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>ZESICA Women’s Summer Wrap V Neck Bohemian Floral Print Ruffle Swing A Line Beach Mini Dress</a> while in search of a low-key-but-still-cute everyday spring wrap dress. I noticed it around 9,000 five-star ratings, so after browsing some customer photos, I decided to place an order. The dress in question comes in sizes S-XXL, and I purchased a Large after reading reviews. Now, I know a Medium might’ve been the better pick, but because I was looking for a laid-back fit, I don’t mind a little extra flow.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/amazon-zesica-mini-dress.jpg><p>This dress comes in 15 patterns, all of which give me <a href=#>major Mamma Mia vibes</a> in all the right ways. I selected Green as my first pick, and after it arrived, it wasn’t long before I ordered the Red version, too. Did it feel like a high-quality, $100 garment? No, of course not, although the quality was pretty darn good. Did it look like a super-cute dress, perfect for a day of spring fun? Absolutely. I took a few photos (OK, a lot of photos) showing off my new ‘fit and received tons of compliments and questions about where the dress was from. I was honestly psyched to tell my friends I got it on Amazon; it felt like a major shopping flex to have found such a diamond in the rough.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/amazon-zesica-dress-try-on.jpg><p>After ordering two color ways in this dress, I was delighted to find that it also comes in <a data-pmc-sp-product=b8fc1280dd77b87a93334877f64b8c58 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"a maxi style","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"ZESICA Women&#39;s 2024 Bohemian Floral Printed Wrap V Neck Short Sleeve Split Beach Party Maxi Dress,Tangerine,Small","price":"49.99","id":"B07RJX41HT","category":"Casual"},"id":1130664,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>a maxi style</a> . YUP. Believe me, I screamed when I saw it. Of course, I then ordered two more dresses, another Red and a print called Tangerine, and with that I closed my computer and decided I absolutely needed to stop shopping. The shorter version and <a data-pmc-sp-product=3160d340e1b923dd35d8d5f1c24b8004 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"the longer style","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"ZESICA Women&#39;s 2024 Bohemian Floral Printed Wrap V Neck Short Sleeve Split Beach Party Maxi Dress,Tangerine,Small","price":"49.99","id":"B07RJX41HT","category":"Casual"},"id":1130664,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>the longer style</a> runs around $45, and they’re seriously worth every penny.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/amazon-zesica-maxi-dress.jpg><p>While I certainly don’t need any more spring dresses, I admit I’ve been eyeing a few other <a href=#>ZESICA silhouettes</a> since my original purchases, and if you convince me, I may just place yet another order. Did I mention all these pieces are available via <a href=#>Amazon Prime</a>? I love the instant gratification of a Monday morning shopping binge and a Wednesday afternoon unboxing! To score these deals and more, make sure you’re <a href=#>signed up as a Amazon Prime member</a>.</p><p>With that, I highly encourage anyone in need of a <a href=# rel=noopener>spring wardrobe upgrade</a> to impulse-buy a ZESICA dress or two. Shipping is fast, returns are easy and there are so many colors and patterns to choose from! I could wax poetic on my Amazon dress love affair, but the moral of the story here is this: Don’t judge a book by its cover, always read the Amazon reviews and you can never have too many sundresses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/banner-newsletter.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xZ6Yra2imnyiucCzpqdlqprAqq%2FAZpurnaOoerOx1aKcsGVhZoBxgpVtZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
