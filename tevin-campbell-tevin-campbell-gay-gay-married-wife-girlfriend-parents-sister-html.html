So to address the rumors, the American singer gave an <a href=# rel="follow noopener">interview</a> with I Love Old School Music&nbsp;back in January 2015. In the interview, he was asked whether he wants people to know what his sexuality is, to which he replied,&nbsp;</p><p>"I’m not gay, but there are a lot of different things that I do like, sexually. Being in the business, you are introduced to a lot of different things. I’m not gay but I’m a freak, and I think a lot of people know what a freak is."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He also added that he is 'not exclusively attracted to men', and being in the entertainment industry, he is introduced to a lot of different things. Similarly, he claimed that he cared less about people's thoughts regarding his sexuality in another <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with MadameNoire&nbsp;in July 2012. He stood out and said: <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>That’s nobody’s business. If someone is interested in me and they wanna be my friend or whatever, then we can talk. It’s nobody’s business what I like to do behind closed doors, ……And I like the fact that people wanna know. Let ‘em wonder. I like to leave a little bit to the imagination. But if you happen to get to know me and we hit it off… I share a lot of personal things with friends, which is a normal thing to do.</p><p>With his statement in the interviews, it is for sure that he is not gay, and the rumors are just baseless assumptions.&nbsp;</p><h2>More On Tevin Campbell</h2><p>Tevin was born on 12 November 1976 in Waxahachie, Texas.
