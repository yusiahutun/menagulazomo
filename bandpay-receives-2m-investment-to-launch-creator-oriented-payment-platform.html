We’re hoping to remove one layer of uncertainty and distrust from their work and let them do more of what they really love doing.”</p><p>BandPay says its platform has been designed to eliminate the potential for “misunderstanding, scope bloat, and fraud,” while “empowering artists to reduce costs and losses for creative projects.” The company plans to use the newly announced investment to build its user base, starting with artists, producers, and other music professionals, as well as to continue building out features to serve them.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ31wfJJoaGtnkpa7pbzAsmSrnZOatrex0mZppmWZo8Omv9OmnKesXam8brjArqWcoF2Yv6at06ipZqeinrKvwMSdZKmZqaKyr8CMqaOarJakv657</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
