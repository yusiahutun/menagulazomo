Not because it has a superficial melody or a campy hook, but because the sound smacks you right in the face. It starts off with a whipping percussion and transitions into an explosive chorus highlighting Briggs's fierce, soulful-rocker vocals. (Think if Florence Welch and Adele's voices had a baby.) Bold, demanding lyrics like, "Shut your mouth and run me like a river" are hard to forget. After being released in January 2016, the track went viral on streaming sites and topped alternative charts.</p><img alt="Face, Hairstyle, Eyebrow, Collar, Textile, Jacket, Style, Black hair, Eyelash, Fashion, " title="Face, Hairstyle, Eyebrow, Collar, Textile, Jacket, Style, Black hair, Eyelash, Fashion, " width=1000 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/15/1492183831-hbz-bishop-briggs-intro-2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jabari Jacobs</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Today, the singer-songwriter (born Sarah Grace McLaughlin) releases her debut self-titled EP, a six-track collection that builds on the power of her singles like "Wild Horses" and "The Way I Do." With the help of producers Mark Jackson and Ian Scott, she continues to define her "dark pop" alternative style with a dance-like bass, trap-influenced hi-hats and gospel background vocals here and there. An eerie new track called "Dark Side"—with a verse that begins, "Welcome to my dark side / It's gonna be a long night"—is perhaps where she speaks most honestly. "It's the person that we are when we close the door," Briggs explains.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The 24-year-old was born in London, raised in Tokyo and Hong Kong before moving to Los Angeles to kickstart her music career. If not by her voice, you can recognize her by her raven pigtails, worn as buns, braids or plain ponies. You'll be seeing a lot more of her now that she's embarked on her first-ever headlining tour.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Before hitting the road, Briggs spoke to HarpersBAZAAR.com about her style, writing process and the backstory behind her biggest song.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">On the success of her song "River":</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"That was the first song I wrote with the producers behind the music; that was our first session together. To have this response has been so incredibly cool, and a huge full-circle moment."</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">On the lyrics:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It was all about the tension, and you can take that and interpret it in whatever way you want, but with nature, it was always something that I always experienced and saw, so it felt like the perfect contrast to life. My hope with that song is it makes people feel empowered [to] take things into their own hands. I always have the visual, especially when I was writing it, to go up to someone's face and egg them on, and ask them to push you to your limits. I think there is something strong and exciting about that."</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">On what inspired the sound:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"There was the trap influence, there is soul and there is sometimes that rock edge—it kind of all flows under the alternative umbrella. And from the beginning, I was really inspired by Alabama Shakes and Hozier, at that time, and Jack Garratt as well. I wanted to make something that felt authentic to me, and felt as honest as possible."</p>https://soundcloud.com/thatgirlbishop/the-way-i-do-1<h2 data-node-id=15 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">On how she got discovered:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I was working at a songwriter's round; I used to play shows in LA every couple nights for years. And one of those random nights, this former A&R rep, George Robertson, walked into the place I was singing at. He was there to see a different artists in the songwriter's round, and I got chosen to go in first. He approached me after, and within a week I got introduced to Mark Jackson and then a couple days later, we met up for our first session and that's when 'River' came about. We kept on writing and we're still writing today."</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">On who she listened to growing up:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Growing up I was listening to a ton of Motown music, Otis Redding, Aretha and then there was the Beatles, and Led Zeppelin and Janis Joplin. These were all people that I felt as though they truly felt every single lyric they said and they weren't afraid of imperfection. If anything, they cuddled it and wanted it to be a part of them. That's what I've been drawn to."</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"Even if no one hears this and no one listens to this song, I can die happily knowing that I finally felt like myself with my music."<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><h2 data-node-id=20 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">On being inspired by her father, who isn't a musician, to pursue music as a career when she was young:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Truly, I never saw myself doing anything other than music. A thing we did as a family was we went to a karaoke bar, and I saw my dad singing Frank Sinatra and immediately I just saw something that I wanted. I saw this light in his eyes, and I think seeing it as a career was something that came a little later because I didn't know if it was possible. But now I want to do it until the day I die to be truly a fulfilled human being."</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">On how writing music is like writing "dark poetry:"</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"For as long as I can remember, I have always been writing dark poetry and it was my outlet and my therapeutic relief. And I think now, whenever I write, there is nothing that will really compare to pen and paper.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The lyrics that you hear in the EP, along those lines, are about looking at things with a darker perspective and having a darker take on the situation. It's just the more real side of humans. It's the person we are when we close the door, and that's generally the side that is less filtered and it's a lot less cheery, and it's very honest."</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">On writing music from a place of sadness:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I think whether it's something you've experienced or felt or heard about, there is a sadness element traced along all of my music because I am just trying to be as unfiltered as possible. I think it's important to note it's never coming from an ungrateful place. I am someone who is so grateful and practice gratitude every single day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"There is something about that human connection, when someone writes something that hits true to them and honest to them. My hope is that whenever I write that there is someone out there that feels a connection and feels as though I understand what they're going through because we've all been through it."</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">On the specific events that inspired the EP:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"As a music lover, I always adore when artists write about what's currently happening in their life. I find that the most interesting to listen to, just because I am extremely nosey. For me, this was such an exciting year compared to all my other years in LA. I also went through a major breakup that fueled a lot of the writing. I think my love for music and my almost-tumultuous relationship with music will always be a source inspiration in my writing as well."</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">On the meaning behind her album cover:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The artist who created that little figurine is this artist named Balloonski. When he created this, it was this little gift for one of my shows. And the moment that we saw it, there was something about it that felt like a more grown-up version of our original stick figure logo. So we were hoping with this symbolic thing, [it] would tie into the EP and keep on growing."</p><h2 data-node-id=34 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">On the moment she realized she found her place:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I think the minute it all began, it felt like something special. I had been meeting people, and you can tell straight away whether it's meant to be or not. With this group, I really felt like I was just myself which was so refreshing. After my first session of writing 'River,' I sat and actually cried, because in that moment I found what I was actually looking for in LA. I was looking for myself and how to express myself and my music, and for it to be as transparent as possible. And I just thought, even if no one hears this and no one listens to this song, I can die happily knowing that I finally felt like myself with my music.</p><img alt="Clothing, Plaid, Tartan, Pattern, Fashion, Street fashion, Textile, Design, Outerwear, Kilt, " title="Clothing, Plaid, Tartan, Pattern, Fashion, Street fashion, Textile, Design, Outerwear, Kilt, " width=1000 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/15/1492180140-hbz-bishop-briggs-style-embed.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Briggs at Summer Camp Music Festival in August 2016.</p><h2 data-node-id=37 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">On her pigtail-wearing, goth-meets-athleisure style:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I think it's really similar to the music in the sense of just remaining true to myself. When I was younger, I was always wearing a backwards hat, and it was the '90s, but I didn't get to dive into '90s fashion because I was too young for it. So it's been really nice searching through my closet and searching through eBay and thrift shops and looking for pieces that are vintage and feel worn. And I like being comfy. I jump around on stage like a maniac and I get really sweaty, so it's important to have things that can handle that."</p><h2 data-node-id=39 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">On being a "daily choker wearer" and finding a new favorite accessory:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It's true! But I have gotten really into chains, because I think in a past life I was a rapper and I've wanted to wear them, but I am aware that my Instagram bio says that! So whenever I wear a chain, I have to throw on a choker. So, I don't know, we'll see how long it lasts."</p><h2 data-node-id=41 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">On how her unique stage name is a tribute to her Scottish roots:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"My whole family is from an area of Scotland called Bishop Briggs. That's where my entire family lived, so I thought that with the new music and this new chapter, it would be a good way for every time I introduce myself, I would be tipping my hat to them and thanking them for all their support. It's also a reminder of where I came from and to always remain grounded. They also think it's funny that my name is Bishop Briggs. It would be very similar if I came to LA. and was like, my artist name is Los Angeles. They find it very funny!"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Stream the Bishop Briggs EP here.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
