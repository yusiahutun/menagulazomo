They’ve been seen publically several times since, from the <a href=#>Super Bowl</a> to their <a href=#>romantic Bahamas getaway</a>. However, they’ve never had the chance to make their official red carpet debut, but fans think (and hope) it could be at Anna Wintour’s Met Gala next month.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-1736565369-750x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-fans-think-she-and-travis-will-make-their-red-carpet-debut-at-this-the-2024-met-gala>Taylor Swift fans think she and Travis will make their red carpet debut at this the 2024 Met Gala</h2><p>Although known as the ‘king’ of fashion, the NFL star has actually never attended the Met Gala. The <a href=#>music</a> star, however, has attended the gala six times, but not since 2016.</p><p>Her last appearance, however, was a memorable one, as it’s said to be where she met her <a href=#>ex-boyfriend, Joe Alwyn</a>. In her hit song Dress, from her album Dress, the lyric states “Flashback when you met me, your buzz cut and my hair bleached,” which is eerily similar to their Met looks.</p><p>However, the former couple called it quits in 2023, after six years together. Later this month, Swift’s new album The Tortured Poets Department will drop, as many suspect it’s a ‘breakup album’ about her six-year relationship. Fans are now convinced she’ll make her red carpet debut with Kelce at the same event, to close the ‘Joe Era’ once and for all.</p><p>One fan theory, posted by <a href=#>Instagram</a> user @scatterbrainsoul, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>: “Not only will it be her red carpet debut, but it could also be a final dig to the Joe Alwyn era,” and it looks like fans agree.</p><p>“Travis did say on his podcast he plans to attend this year’s event and even try to talk Jason into going,” wrote one convinced fan.</p><p>“God I hope so. He loves fashion as much as anyone. This was made for them,” penned another.</p><p>It doesn’t look too unrealistic either as the Cruel Summer singer is free on that date. The prestigious event takes place on Monday 6 May at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York.</p><p>The European leg of the Eras Tour kicks off on Thursday 9 May in Paris, giving her plenty of time to make it there.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-our-fave-met-gala-look-from-the-star>Our fave Met Gala look from the star</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-488338597-1024x682.jpg><p>With six stunning, but hugely different looks to choose from, it was hard to pick our fave. However, after long and thoughtful consideration, we decided the 34-year-old’s 2014 look was our fave.</p><p>Swift brought old-school <a href=#>Hollywood</a> glam to the red carpet in 2014 Met Gala, with the theme “Charles James: Beyond Fashion.”&nbsp;</p><p>She opted for an Oscar de la Renta pink dress, equipped with matte gold sequins, pearl beads, and silver-lined seed beads. From the front, it was giving cutesy girly vibes. However, the dramatic vibes of the back is what made this one stand out. The trail, which can only be described as a bridal look caught everyone’s eye.</p><p>Her short hair was in bouncy Hollywood curls, and she finished the look off with her <a href=#>signature red lip</a>. But it’s not the only thing that makes it our winner. In fact, the dress was so durable, that it survived a cat attack.</p><p>OG Swifities will remember her tweet: “That moment when your cat casually walks up, then abruptly ATTACKS your custom satin Oscar de la Renta gown during your fitting for Met Ball,” followed with a cute picture of her and bestie&nbsp;Karlie Kloss.</p><p>And that’s why it’s our deserving winner!</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2WEcMDAsqOoql2Wu6V506uYr6GjYrCwwcudZKaZm5p6tbTEoqlmqpWZeqSt0amcrWWUmq%2B2wIyaq2asmJp6rrHTZp6apJFis6K6jK2fnqeirnq0wcagnKyso2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
