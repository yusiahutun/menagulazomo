A torrent file that you download from the internet is nothing more than a tiny file that shows your torrent client where to look for other users hosting the real file that you want.</p><p>The illegal part is pirating material such as movies or music albums. Sharing copyrighted content without paying for it is, obviously, still a crime, no matter how you do it.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>When you use a torrent, you are not only downloading the file—you're also hosting it for others to download from you. This means using that of a torrent to download a file like a movie could get you in a lot of trouble.</p><p>Torrents can also be used for all sorts of legitimate purposes, such as when sharing open-source software like Linux distributions. This method allows the software to be available to everyone without requiring the original developer to host the file themselves. This is important for free and open-source software. It makes everything much more accessible for everybody.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Other legal use for torrents include sharing non-copyrighted movies or commercial commons' music. Many older movies are now in the public domain, which means they are free to watch, distribute, and share.
