Think sexually transmitted diseases. Think pregnancy. Here’s how it happens: Semen has&nbsp;a sneaky way of slipping out one orifice and into another. The distance from the anus to the vagina is about a centimeter&nbsp;away. It takes the right time of month, no contraception, and one fast swimmer to make a baby. The notion that anal penetration is a sure way to avoid pregnancy is a myth that needs to be detonated.</p><p>Now, let’s go back to HIV, AIDS, and STI’s. Uncovered anal penetration is the number one sexual activity that carries the highest risk of infection. A penis thrusting into a tight dry hole that is contracting and resisting rather than expanding and inviting, is very likely going to cause the skin to tear. Ejaculation from anyone who is infected easily enters this broken skin and voila—an STI is passed on. Unless your partner has been recently tested and you know he’s clean—and even then, there really aren’t any guarantees; people cheat—your mantra&nbsp;should be: No glove, no love. Condoms and anal lube are non-negotiables with anal play. Reassure your guy that it’s not a matter of mistrust, it’s a matter of comfort and a way to ensure safe and healthy anal play.</p><p>By the way, keep condoms on hand because if you enjoy anal as well as vaginal penetration, you need to change condoms when you switch orifices. The last thing you want is bacteria being moved from one hole&nbsp;to the next!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/safe-come-in-you-during-anal3.jpg><h2><strong>Q: How come my boyfriend&nbsp;can sometimes feel my IUD when we have sex, but not always?</strong></h2><p><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;First, a quick anatomy refresh: An IUD is inserted inside the uterus, via the cervix.&nbsp;The cervix is two to three centimeters&nbsp;long and connects the vagina and uterus. The average vagina is three to four inches&nbsp;long and can expand like a balloon by about 200 percent—seriously—when you’re turned on. The average erect penis is about 5 inches long. Mother nature likes symmetry and anatomical jigsaw puzzles.</p><p>So, the&nbsp;IUD sits inside your uterus and has strings hanging into your vagina to ensure your health care provider can remove it when you want to. You’re supposed to feel the strings when you reach your fingers deep inside your vagina. And in turn your boyfriend will also be able to feel these strings. But&nbsp;because your IUD can shift slightly in your uterus depending on your cycle, he might not feel them every time. If you have pain&nbsp;or discomfort related to this,&nbsp;be sure to reach out to your health care provider, since your IUD should not inhibit you nor your partner sexually. Try different positions&nbsp;until&nbsp;you find one that’s&nbsp;comfortable for both of you. When you’re really turned on, your vagina will engorge, and no strings will be felt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/safe-come-in-you-during-anal4.jpg><h2><strong>Q: Are uncircumcised penises less hygienic?</strong></h2><p><strong>A:</strong> Imagine the folds of your genitals. They are interesting, and get more interesting as you unfold them and discover different sensations. You know when you shower, you need to unfold and uncover each part, and wash each part with warm soapy water. The same goes for uncut penises: Men need to give each part hygienic attention. It takes a little more time for uncircumcised&nbsp;do a daily clean. Moisture can get trapped between the penis and the foreskin, and bacteria love warm, moist places.</p><p>Sexually transmitted infections, specifically HPV and HIV, are more easily passed on by uncut men—hence the extra need for attention to genital hygiene. There is no definitive research that says women have more or less sexual pleasure with cut or uncut men. In terms of men’s own pleasure, unfortunately some men get circumcised in the hope it will delay their ejaculation—which is not always the best idea, given that some men report enjoying the extra sensitivity they feel once cut, while others say they actually feel less sensitive without a foreskin. It can really go either way.</p><p>A few more tips for getting (and giving) better sex with an uncut man: Before oral sex, retract his foreskin so he can feel every sensation. Use lube when you’re giving him a hand job; otherwise the movement can be painful. Watch him masturbate and copy his tugging or gentle caressing of his foreskin. When in doubt,&nbsp;since some foreskins are sturdy and others delicate, ask him how he likes you to touch him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/safe-come-in-you-during-anal2.png><h2><strong>Q: I hate waxes but my partner loves me&nbsp;bare.&nbsp;Who wins?</strong></h2><p><strong>A:</strong> Pubic hair is so personal. It’s also political, follows trends, and, as in your situation, impacts power dynamics in a relationship. Personally, I think lying with legs spread in front of a stranger wielding a hot pot of wax can be daunting, bizarrely&nbsp;intimate, and damn painful. Politically, from a feminist perspective, you know it’s your hair, your body, and your genitals; thus your right to determine how much or how little of it there is.</p><p>Trends is where it gets interesting. The media exposes us to&nbsp;all kinds of repeated&nbsp;images of smooth vulvas clearly visible in tight jeans, &nbsp;bikini bottoms, and Victoria’s Secret panties—which then become idealized and normalized. If you choose to&nbsp;buck&nbsp;this trend and maintain&nbsp;your individuality by keeping your bush, good on you, I say!&nbsp; However, your boyfriend has been influenced by these trendy images, and I’d guess porn has been his trendsetter. And if you watch porn, you know that “bush” genre is also popular for people seeking unusual-looking genitals at a time when&nbsp;bare, smooth Barbie-looking labia are the norm. In other words, his erotic cues are tuned into bare.</p><p>How you manage this depends on how much you value this man and your&nbsp;relationship. If you love one another, I’m guessing it won’t be a deal breaker no matter what you decide. Perhaps you’ll shave or wax for six months, and then go wild for six as a compromise. The higher the&nbsp;relationship’s&nbsp;value, the more likely you are to talk about it, get an understanding of why he wants smooth, and then decide if this is the place to flex your power muscles and push for your rights—or&nbsp;give up the bush.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/safe-come-in-you-during-anal5.png><h2><strong>Q: We&nbsp;want to try a threesome, but I’m weirded out by doing it with a friend or&nbsp;a sex worker. Ideas?</strong></h2><p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong>Choosing a friend adds emotional complications. Sex workers offer a clean transaction, as it comes with built-in boundaries, but understandably it is not for everyone. I suggest you try online dating sites, swingers groups, even Tinder or Grindr. And I strongly&nbsp;recommend you meet socially in public a few times before bedroom antics begin to ensure everyone’s comfortable together.</p><p>I also suggest&nbsp;that as you start to&nbsp;explore consensual non-monogamy, you enter this brave new world with a firm agreement in place—and the “who” you’re going to jump into bed with is only one part of that. Some tips: Talk a lot about both of your motivations for wanting to open up your relationship. Most couples enter threesomes consensually to strengthen and eroticize their own intimacy, which means that you need a strong relationship to avoid risks such as cheating or&nbsp;discovering&nbsp;this was your partner’s&nbsp;cowardly way of ending your relationship.</p><p>It’s also important to accept that you don’t know how you’ll feel during and after the first time you have someone new in bed with you and your partner. Good communication before and after acts as a buffer to what can be deeply complex feelings.&nbsp;Be very clear on personal boundaries&nbsp;around&nbsp;your own levels of comfortability. For example, you may not want your partner alone in the room with your third invitee;&nbsp;you may ban and permit certain sexual activities; or you may not want any contact with the new person after the fact.&nbsp;And, because this can’t be said enough times, always use condoms.</p><p>Put this all together and be sure you both agree to the terms before moving forward. It sounds unsexy, but it’s what will keep the experience a positive one.&nbsp;And finally, know that you can say NO at any time—even when the third person is already in your bed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8uorZ5lo5rFcIKQbmtwcV%2BorqexjJympp1dnrtuxc6uZJ2top67qHnAp5ilZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
