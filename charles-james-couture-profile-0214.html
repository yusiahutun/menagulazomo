In the Pantheon of legendary 20th-century couturiers—Lanvin, Chanel, Dior, and Balenciaga among them—one name is missing: James. That's Charles James, the once revered Anglo-American designer who, these days, is better described as a forgotten genius. At the height of his career, James designed sumptuous, sculptural, otherworldly gowns for the glamorous likes of Austine Hearst (wife of William Randolph Hearst Jr., and one of his most devoted patrons), Babe Paley, Marlene Dietrich, Millicent Rogers, and Gypsy Rose Lee—women who could have had any dress by any designer but were willing to wait months, even years, for a dress made by James."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That's Charles James, the once revered Anglo-American designer who, these days, is better described as a forgotten genius. At the height of his career, James designed sumptuous, sculptural, otherworldly gowns for the glamorous likes of Austine Hearst (wife of William Randolph Hearst Jr., and one of his most devoted patrons), Babe Paley, Marlene Dietrich, Millicent Rogers, and Gypsy Rose Lee—women who could have had any dress by any designer but were willing to wait months, even years, for a dress made by James. His wasp-waisted silhouettes anticipated Christian Dior's paradigm-shifting 1947 New Look collection, and none other than Cristóbal Balenciaga lauded James as "not only the greatest American couturier, but the world's best and only dressmaker who has raised haute couture from an applied art form to a pure art form." Yet James spent the last decade of his life impecunious and alone in his Chelsea Hotel studio, surrounded by drawings and newspaper clippings aged the color of nicotine stains. Thirty-six years after his death, his name remains virtually unknown outside a small circle of fashion insiders.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2011, "Charles James: Genius Deconstructed," a show at the Chicago History Museum, set the stage for a James revival. This spring, two exhibitions may finally solidify his place in the fashion firmament. On May 8, "Charles James: Beyond Fashion" opens at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute in New York, and at the end of May, "A Thin Wall of Air: Charles James" begins a three-month run at the Menil Collection in Houston. The Met exhibition will showcase James's extraordinary satin and tulle ball gowns (including several from Austine Hearst's singular collection), which tended to feature a structured bodice, a plunging neckline, an hourglass waist, and a full skirt that billowed to the floor like expensive silk curtains. "His dresses healed every flaw," Austine Hearst once said, recalling a satin gown with an underskirt so voluminous it forced her dinner companions to perch sideways on their chairs.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But for James's acolytes, such accommodations were a small price to pay for dresses that made them look as majestic as royals from a 19th-century court painting, and immediately identified them as members of society's highest echelons. "Just to have the dress, you were already acknowledged to have a level of taste, refinement, and a social profile that was beyond anything anyone else had," says Harold Koda, co-curator of the Costume Institute show.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Austine's son Austin Hearst recalls his mother floating out of the house for special events in Charles James dresses, like a swan about to take flight. "James had a huge impact on my mother," he says. "She spoke about him as if he were godlike, and she really did appreciate these things not like dresses, but like pieces of jewelry or pieces of art."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A number of James's most remarkable designs—several named after natural forms—were made for Hearst, who was one of James's favorites, no doubt because she was as thin as a willow branch, with perfect, regal posture. The Butterfly dress, a column of silk and faille, was tucked into diagonal folds so fine they resembled a bony rib cage, behind which an enormous skirt of tulle spread its wings. Another gem from Austine's collection, the showstopping Clover (sometimes called the Four-Leaf Clover), named for its four-quadrant skirt, was constructed from an astonishing 30 pattern pieces. "The most beautiful dresses he created—I don't want to be biased—were for my mother," says Austin.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If the Met exhibition is a panoramic painting of James's career, the show at the Menil Collection is a detail within that painting—a micro-study of the designer's relationship with one set of patrons, John and Dominique de Menil. For Dominique, James designed what amounted to an impressive collection of coats, daywear, and eveningwear: a red fleece cape with dolman sleeves, a chocolate silk Infanta cocktail dress with a full skirt and a cutout neckline, an opera coat made from saffron damask silk and lined in ice blue satin.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But perhaps the most interesting of James's creations for the Menils was the interior of their 1950 Philip Johnson house, a modernist landmark in the grand Houston enclave of River Oaks. James covered the doors of the home in rich fuchsia velvet; he swathed the walls in luxurious butterscotch-hued felt. He filled the austere Miesian structure with furniture in Rococo, Baroque, and Gothic styles, designing some of the pieces himself. A sofa shaped like a pair of lips "drove upholsterers wild," said Dominique, and took five successive artisans three years to upholster to James's specifications. "Despite his romantic claim that 'the relation between all first-class designers and clients is a love affair,'" Hilton Als wrote in The New Yorker, "with James, always, the primary love affair was between himself and his creation."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Born in England in 1906, the privileged but wayward son of a British military officer and a Chicago socialite, James was expelled from the prestigious Harrow School in his teens. Soon after, he began his career as a milliner in Chicago as Charles Boucheron, borrowing the surname because his father disapproved of fashion. His designs quickly became favorites among wealthy women of taste. James opened three shops in Chicago before moving to New York in 1928, and then to London the following year. He spent the next decade shuttling between London and Paris, selling his hats to American department stores. But by the early '30s he'd begun designing clothes, applying millinery techniques—like draping and cutting material directly on the body—to his work as a dressmaker.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">His gowns were unlike anything women had ever seen; they expanded the notion of what an evening gown could be. "He was informed by traditional craft, by the highest levels of haute couture, but he used those standards and approaches as the stepping-off point for a completely personal way of making clothes," says Koda. Under the clouds of chiffon and tulle was a solid, almost Victorian, infrastructure—boned bodice, bustle-like hip pads, layers and layers of petticoats—that held the fabric aloft. "When you actually start to tease apart the elements, it's like no one else," Koda adds.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The studies for James's designs are more like blueprints than fashion sketches. They illustrate feats of technical innovation, such as using heat-set plastic boning to give the Clover skirt its distinctive shape. The photographer Bill Cunningham, a longtime friend, dubbed James "the Einstein of fashion." Gowns that tipped the scales at 10, 15, even 25 pounds were engineered to distribute their weight evenly, rendering them wearable. At least it seems that no woman ever complained about the burden, perhaps because they knew just how wondrous they were to behold.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Everyone turns when I sweep into the room," Austine Hearst wrote of wearing a James confection, "the gentlemen in admiration, the ladies in envy." As Koda puts it, "A Charles James dress virtually ensured that, visually, you'd be wearing the most important dress at that event."</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DRESSES HE CREATED—I DON'T WANT TO BE BIASED—WERE FOR MY MOTHER."—AUSTIN HEARST<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The point of all this complicated construction was indeed to make a woman look magnificent—not a magnificent version of herself, but like the magnificent ideal in James's mind. James once described his Tree dress (a pillar of tightly gathered fabric that evoked tree bark) as "faille stretched like a ruched membrane over a stiffened shell molded NOT to the figure of the client, but to the shape I wished it were." He chose and carefully vetted those who would wear his designs, working with "only a very refined and edited group," notes Koda. He was so controlling about the presentation of his work that he often modeled his own pieces; he also trained his clients how best to move, sit, and dance in them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Perhaps not surprisingly, his professional relationships tended to be difficult. He refused to hew to any timeline but his own, billed incorrectly, and regularly defaulted on contracts. He was maddeningly perfectionistic, often to the point of absurdity: He reputedly once spent three years and $20,000 refining a sleeve. If a potential client didn't meet his standards, he could be devastatingly caustic. "I couldn't possibly make anything for a frump like you," Anne, Countess of Rosse, recounted James saying to a friend she'd brought to meet him. "Why, you can't even walk properly!"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Over time, he fell out with almost everyone: A brief 1950s partnership with the ready-to-wear manufacturer Samuel Winston ended in a suit for breach of contract; a 1970 collaboration with Halston went up in flames, with James accusing the younger designer of stealing his ideas. His marriage to Nancy Lee Gregory, one of his wealthy patrons, was also short-lived; the couple had two children but separated in 1961 after only seven years together. (Because James was known to be homosexual, the union was widely considered to be a financial move, but James insisted it was not. "I wanted to be married," he told New York magazine shortly before his death. "That's not so special, is it? No one could believe that I could love a woman.") Many of James's supporters thought that his combativeness was an element of his creative process. "People said, 'Oh, he's his own worst enemy,'" Dominique de Menil once remarked, "but it's not exactly like that—it's not that simple. He needed confrontation, opposition, in order to give the best of himself."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"When you see images of his work spaces, there is this intensity of chaos," says Susan Sutton, curator of the Menil show. "He was an artist existing in the world; he was not about a business-minded methodical track record." While most scholars believe that James's inability to maintain relationships played a primary role in his oblivion, Koda argues that we don't remember James because he simply refused to pass the baton: "His head would have exploded if someone took his name and said, 'I'm doing Charles James,'" Koda asserts. "His ego was such that Charles James's business was Charles James's, not someone else's. He felt he was sui generis, and he was."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">By the 1940s, James had begun to preserve his legacy by asking patrons like Hearst and Rogers to donate pieces to the Brooklyn Museum (whose costume collections were acquired by the Met in 2009); and in 1964 he hired the illustrator Antonio Lopez to document his work. But there was only so much he could do. James's tendency to burn bridges, his poor financial sense, his habit of shuttering his businesses and setting up under a new name whenever he fell too far into debt, surely contributed to his obscurity.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And yet, however much James's uncompromising vision cost him, his confections were magical, like apparitions from a dream. The women who wore them stood out, "like exotic birds from an enchanted forest," said Cunningham. The gowns also photographed beautifully, and the resulting images—by Louise Dahl-Wolfe, Lillian Bassman, Horst, Richard Avedon, and Cecil Beaton—are as iconic as the dresses themselves. In a Dahl-Wolfe image from 1947, a sylph-like woman in a pale blue strapless gown sweeps a gloved arm over her shoulder: She is elegance personified.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">James's creations are proof that he privileged artistry above all else—they evince his maniacal attention to detail, his disregard for limitations of time and financial concerns and anything but his own aesthetic principles. All of which makes him, in this moment of fast fashion and ephemeral trends, an artist of note: not merely a designer's designer, but a designer with lessons for our time.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Amanda Fortini, has written for Elle and The New York Times, among other publications, and is the Beverly Rogers Fellow at the Black Mountain Institute at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGielZbBtr7ErGaaaWRqfnCvx5qppZ2jYreiucSsZJynpanCs7GMqamonpmhsm58kWpraA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
