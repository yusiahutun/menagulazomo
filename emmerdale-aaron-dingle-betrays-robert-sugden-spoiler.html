However, he returns home full of optimism and starts making plans for the next stages without the full consent of his husband. Aaron later goes behind Robert's back and meets a surrogate called Lucie, and is determined to secure her as their surrogate. Later, Robert enthuses about a contract he's secured, complete with a cash deposit, but Aaron is quick to eye up the money. Is he about to do something he will regret?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/050d83a4f0b0-emmerdale-jacob-maya-david-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=elko-seIUsiE data-wc=8><strong>David's romantic night away doesn't go to plan</strong></p><h3>Jacob ruins David and Maya's romantic plans</h3><p id=eRPLB8OrTi58 data-wc=76>David prepares to take Maya for a night away, but Jacob is evidently jealous and doesn’t do a very good job at hiding this.

The next day, as Jessie and Marlon make preparations for their time away, Chas catches Paddy looking at Bear Wolf's website. Paddy makes a huge decision and confesses to Chas that he is planning on following Bear Wolf out there, and with Chas' approval, he then asks Marlon if he can join him and Jessie on their honeymoon. Meanwhile, Kerry has asked Jessie if she can join them on the honeymoon so that she can look for her daughter Amy, and while Jessie initially refuses, she soon changes her mind when she finds out that Paddy will be there.
