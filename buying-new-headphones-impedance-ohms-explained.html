So, questions arise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What are impedance and ohms when it comes to headphones? More importantly, how does impedance affect the sound quality of headphones?</p><p>Don’t worry. We’ve done the hard work, so you don’t have to. Let’s see what impedance and ohms mean and how they affect sound quality.</p><h2 id=what-is-headphone-impedance>What Is Headphone Impedance?</h2><p>Before discussing headphone impedance, we have to look at electrical resistance. Once you understand electrical resistance, impedance will make much more sense.</p><p>Whenever electricity flows through a wire, it experiences electrical resistance that hinders the flow of current. Different wires and conductors have different resistance levels. To understand electric resistance better, imagine a water pipe. The flow of water through a pipe differs depending upon the pipe. Some pipes have a larger diameter, making the flow easier. On the other hand, pipes with smaller diameters have restricted flow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Testing-resistance-for-diode-1.jpg><p>The resistance of a conductor is measured in ohms. In short, every conductor has an electrical resistance that restricts the flow of electric current.</p><p>The impedance of headphones is the electrical resistance of the driver unit present inside the headphones. And because impedance is resistance, it is measured in ohms. The normal impedance range of headphones is between 8 and 600 ohms.</p><p>Typically, headphones with impedance less than 25 ohms are termed “low impedance headphones.” Headphones with an impedance of more than 25 ohms are called “high impedance headphones.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-does-impedance-affect-the-sound-quality-of-headphones>How Does Impedance Affect the Sound Quality of Headphones?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/microphone-pop-shield-headphones-home-studio-setup.jpg><p>Impedance has a massive effect on the sound quality of headphones. For instance, if you fail to correctly pair headphones with audio sources based on the impedance of the headphones, the sound quality will take a massive hit.</p><p>Generally, the higher the impedance of a pair of headphones, the better the sound quality. But to drive headphones with high impedance levels, you will need amplifiers. Otherwise, the <a href=#>volume will be too low</a>.</p><p>For instance, the Beyerdynamic Dt770 Pro has a version with 250 ohms. To use these headphones, you will have to hook them up to an external amplifier.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Are High-Res Headphones and Are They Worth the Money?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the other hand, lower headphones have low power demands and can be used with phones and portable music players. But the sound quality of headphones with impedance levels of less than 25 ohms lags behind high impedance ones.</p><h2 id=what-impedance-headphones-should-you-pick-up>What Impedance Headphones Should You Pick Up?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Audible-Plans-Explained-Featured.jpg><p>If you want headphones for casual listening of music on your phone or computer, headphones with impedance levels less than or equal to 25 ohms will be sufficient for you. But if you want audiophile-grade gear to use in the studio or to listen to uncompressed, high-fidelity music, get high impedance headphones with an impedance rating of more than 30 ohms.</p><p>In short, if you want ease and accessibility, go with low impedance ones. And if you want a studio-quality pair, you’ll have to deal with high-impedance. In the latter case, you’ll also want to <a href=#>invest in an amp</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=make-sure-to-pair-your-headphones-with-the-right-audio-equipment>Make Sure to Pair Your Headphones With the Right Audio Equipment</h2><p>Pairing headphones with the correct audio equipment is crucial for a good listening experience. Connecting low impedance headphones to external amplifiers can blow them out, resulting in horrible audio quality.</p><p>Similarly, failing to connect headphones with an impedance greater than 30 ohms will result in a much quieter and inconsistent audio experience.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiZrrGZo7RuusSwZKGdkZm9qbvNnqpmoZ2lsqWtzZycZqeYosBusdepo5qhnpqxcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
