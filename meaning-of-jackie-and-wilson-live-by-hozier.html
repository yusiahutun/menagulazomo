The lyrics tell a story of two individuals who come together in the midst of their struggles and embark on a journey to escape the hardships of their lives. The song explores the idea of finding refuge in each other and the power of connection.One standout lyric in the song is "So tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes, no better version of me I could pretend to be tonight." This lyric speaks to the exhaustion and weariness the protagonist feels, trying to navigate through life's challenges. It conveys the idea that they are searching for someone who can see beyond their flaws and accept them as they are.Another poignant line in the song is "She blows out of nowhere, a Roman candle of the wild, laughing her way through my feeble disguise." This lyric depicts a sense of spontaneity and excitement that the protagonist finds in the other person. It suggests that they bring a spark into each other's lives, helping them escape the mundanity and constraints they feel.The chorus of the song, particularly the line "We'll steal her Lexus, be detectives, ride round picking up clues," presents an imaginative theme of embracing a life of adventure and exploration. It suggests that the duo will embark on a thrilling journey, seeking new experiences and discovering the unknown. This theme highlights the escapism the song explores by symbolizing getting away from the monotony of everyday life and instead diving headfirst into the unknown.Furthermore, the lyric "Looking up from a cigarette, and she's already left" suggests a theme of impermanence and the fleeting nature of their relationship. This theme explores the idea that the initial connection and escapism they found in each other might be short-lived. It intimates that their time together could be temporary, leaving the protagonist longing for the sense of comfort and freedom they experienced.Lastly, the final verse of the song includes the lines "Cut clean from the dream at night, let my mind reset" and "Start digging up the yard for what's left of me in our little vignette." These lyrics hint at a larger theme of self-discovery and rebirth. The protagonist seeks to distance themselves from the dreamlike state, wanting to start afresh and redefine who they are.
