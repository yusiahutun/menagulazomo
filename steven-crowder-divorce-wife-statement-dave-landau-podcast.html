It was his rant button and it was basically a ‘Dave Don’t Talk’ button," he said.</p><p>"When it was hit, I wasn't supposed to talk... and [Crowder] would press it."</p><p>Landau admitted that he knew Crowder was the "star of the show" and said he never tried to overstep his boundaries with the commentary he provided.</p><p>"It was just, ‘hey, don’t be funnier [than Crowder].’&nbsp;That's the truth. I mean it sounds bitter but I knew it was true because I was pulled aside and it was, ‘make sure if you’re doing a rant or you’re riffing, he gets the last word," he said.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Malice asked: "You were told this explicitly?"</p><p>"Yes." Landau said.</p><p>The comedian went on to say that he loved the staff behind the program and enjoyed working with them "but I think they are kind of just a little bit intimidated at this point to keep their own job."</p><p>Landau said that Crowder's supposed censorship had extended to fellow comic, Matt McClowry at one point.</p><p>Landau planned a comedy special in Dallas that Crowder asked to participate in and Landau agreed knowing that the popular <a href=#>YouTuber</a> and political commentator would help promote it.</p><p>Thanks to Crowder's connections, the special was able to sell out two shows.</p><p>McClowry, who is good friends with Landau, opened both shows and earned a standing ovation.</p><p>Because of this, Landau asked Crowder if McClowry could co-host Louder with Crowder on a day that he could be there, to which Crowder agreed.</p><p>However, Landau later learned that McClowry was blocked from the guest co-hosting gig without explanation.</p><p>He claimed that Crowder texted him, "What's done is done."</p><p>"What does that mean? It's your show," Landau reportedly texted back.</p><p>"He told me he owns me..." Landau said, recalling the conversation. "It was venomous …&nbsp;I saw a different person that I had heard rumors about."</p><h2>SHOCKING VIDEO</h2><p>The news comes as the family of <a href=#>Crowder's ex-wife</a> released a statement and video footage to writer, <a href=# aria-label="Yas (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yas</a><a href=#>har Ali</a>, accusing Crowder of emotional abuse.</p><p>The Ring Camera footage shows Crowder arguing with Hilary who was nearly eight months <a href=#>pregnant</a> at the time with the couple's twins.</p><p>Crowder forbade Hilary from using their car "because you refuse to do wifely things.</p><p>"The only way out of this is discipline and respect," he says.</p><p>An emotionally distraught Hilary says later in the video, "I love you but your abuse is sick."</p><p>Crowder, who appears to be smoking a cigar, says, "Watch it. Watch it. F*****g watch it."</p><p>Hilary tells her then-husband that she needs space but that she loves him but Crowder replies "I don't love you. That's the big problem. I've never received love from you."</p><p>A statement from Hilary's family revealed that she is currently living in Dallas and is focused on taking care of her children.</p><p>"She is not prepared at this time to speak about her divorce becoming public or the misleading statements made by Steven about their relationship," the statement continued.</p><p>"The truth is that Hilary spent years hiding Steven's mentally and emotionally abusive behavior from her friends and family while she attempted to save their marriage.</p><p>"She was the one who was asking to work on their relationship to keep the marriage intact for their unborn children."</p><p>The statement ended with the family hoping that Crowder "will cease speaking publicly about these personal matters in an untruthful manner.</p><p>"We also look forward to there being full transparency in the legal process so there is fairness and accountability for the actions that caused the divorce, and to ensure the outcome is what is in the best interests of the young children."</p><h2>'NOT MY CHOICE'</h2><p>On Tuesday, Crowder announced that he and his wife <a href=#>were getting a divorce after a decade of marriage</a>.</p><p>"I have been living with a proverbial boot on my neck for going on years now," Crowder&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>.</p><p>"Since 2021, I've been living through what has increasingly been a horrendous&nbsp;<a href=#>divorce</a>."</p><p>Crowder clarified that the end of his&nbsp;<a href=#>marriage</a>&nbsp;wasn't a result of infidelity or any kind of physical abuse on either side.</p><p>"And no, this was not my choice," he added. "My then-wife&nbsp;decided that she didn't want to be married anymore and in the state of&nbsp;<a href=#>Texas</a>, that is completely permitted."</p><p>Crowder called it the most heartbreaking experience of his life and considers the divorce his "deepest personal failure."</p><p>He said that he and&nbsp;his ex-wife Hilary decided to keep the issue private for the safety of their two children.</p><p>"In all this, one thing I wanna be really clear about is certain. True north here is that my children are blameless, completely without fault, and so we decided to resolve these issues privately as it's in their best interest both emotionally and physically to do so."</p><p>It's unclear if the divorce has been finalized yet but Crowder says that it has been an issue that he has been dealing with for "years."</p><p>"I loved a woman so much that I married her," said Crowder.</p><p>"A woman who, despite all of this, I still love as the mother of my children and she wanted something else for her life.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"That's not my choice, she simply wanted out and the law says that that's how it works."</p><p>The U.S. Sun has reached out to Steven Crowder for comment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/www-youtube-com-watch-v-813167193.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/choice-steven-crowder-announces-horrendous-812660675.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvaW2CcYSTaKqtnaaau26v0aiunZ2iYrGqws6rmp5lp56zpnnSrZitnZ2au7V5w5qtnmWclrulrdRmp6ick5bAtXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
