With three game modes for Campaign, Multiplayer, and Invasion, there is plenty of fun to keep you entertained.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>While the game does work with a joystick, for portability you can use your keyboard. Move your tank using the <strong>arrow keys</strong> or <strong>WASD</strong>. Aim with <strong>J</strong> and <strong>L</strong>, and fire with the <strong>Space</strong> key. Defend, defeat, and dominate in Tank Riders.</p><h3 id=spelunky>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spelunky</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/spelunky.jpg><p>Spelunky is a cave exploration game that offers something new every time you playâ€”literally, since the cave's layout alters.

With a simple goal of guiding your ball to the basket, the challenge quickly mounts with the many puzzles you must solve and dangerous obstacles in the way. Watch out for fire, bounce around spikes, and use trampolines to get to your goal.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Use the<strong> arrows</strong> to guide your basketball and the <strong>Space</strong> key to bounce. If you press the <strong>Space</strong> key rapidly, you will create a power jump which is necessary to overcome some obstacles. Basket & Ball is definitely tricky, but also a lot of fun.</p><h2 id=board-and-card-games>Board and Card Games</h2><h3 id=memo-flip>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Memo-Flip</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/memo-flip.jpg><p>Memo-Flip is a simple card memory game. You click to flip over two cards, trying to find a matching pair.

This version for Chrome offers nine different modes for you to choose from including Klondike, Pyramid, Free Cell, and Spider.</p><p>You can drag the cards to the spots you want or simply click on one and it will automatically move to the most obvious location for you.

If you love Solitaire, then you're bound to enjoy this offline version.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>You can also <a href=#>bring back the classic Windows games</a> and enjoy them offline.</p><h2 id=puzzle-games>Puzzle Games</h2><h3 id=cut-the-rope>6. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cut the Rope</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/cut-the-rope-chrome-web-app.jpg><p>While the game has been around for years, the award-winning Cut the Rope is still a fun and amusing physics puzzler. Your goal is to feed candy to the cute monster named Om Nom. To do so, you must solve the puzzles to feed him his treat while attempting to collect three stars in each level.</p><p>As the name implies, you do this by cutting the rope in the right order, sending the candy swinging through the level. Watch out for spiky objects, use bubbles to your advantage, and keep Om Nom happy as you move through the various worlds and levels.</p><h3 id=2048>7. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2048</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2048-chrome-web-app.jpg><p>The puzzling and challenging 2048 is still a popular brain-teaser. Gameplay begins by sliding tiles up, down, left, or right. The numbers on the tiles will merge when they match. For example, when two 4's combine, it will create 8. The objective is to continue merging and doubling numbers before running out of space on the board.</p><p>Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to shift the tiles in the desired direction. You will score while you make moves; when the tiles on the board fill up, your game is over. To get your brain pumping while on the way to work, 2048 is perfect.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h3 id=word-seek>8. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Word Seek</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/word-seek.jpg><p>If you're after some good old-fashioned <a href=#>word search fun</a>, download the free offline game Word Seek for Chrome.

While the game is easy to learn, it's difficult to master. Your goal is to create a path that touches each of the nodes before reaching the goal. Red lines are your obstacles, so you must make your moves around them.</p><p>To make your moves, just select the node you want to move to and your path will begin. You can restart a level if needed. There are eight stages with 20 levels each. If you like games that flex those gray cells, Link All is one to try.</p><h3 id=little-alchemy>10. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Little Alchemy</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/little-alchemy.jpg><p>Little Alchemy is a deceptively simple, yet wonderfully addictive, game that sees you combining elements to create all sorts of wondrous things.</p><p>You begin with just four basic items (air, earth, fire, and water), which you <strong>click and drag</strong> to the main board.
