The claims were focused on “suspected offences of overcharging of commission or non-compliance with the Code of Practice for Employment Agencies”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She said authorities had investigated cases and conducted “surprise inspections to examine [the agency’s] documents”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Two cases were prosecuted – with “evidence substantiating that the [agency] staff had overcharged the commission of HK$4,779.49 and HK$11,580.61 from two foreign domestic workers”, the spokeswoman said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While the agent was acquitted in one case, she was convicted on May 31 last year of overcharging a domestic worker and was sentenced to a fine of HK$8,000, in addition to being ordered to refund the excessive placement fee.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the agent has appealed and a judgment on that appeal has yet to be handed down.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If the appeal is dismissed, the spokeswoman said the agency’s licence would be revoked.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The remaining cases, she added, were under investigation or could not be prosecuted “due to reasons, such as refusal of the complainants to act as the prosecution witness or no evidence found to substantiate an offence”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong helper with Covid-19 says boss made her isolate overnight in parked car</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ivy Lau, assistant consultant with Talent (Kenya) Company Limited, rejected the accusations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“After those girls understand the job nature and law [of] Hong Kong, they need to sign the contract and documents in front of a lawyer.

All of those complaints are fake complaints about us,” Lau said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She claimed that she never told helpers to work 90 days without days off – but workers shared screenshots of conversations that suggest otherwise.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“After they arrive in Hong Kong and work in the employer’s house, my job is finished … Even [if] she wants to leave her job, this is her right,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lau alleged that non-profit advocates have misled some “naive” domestic workers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They don’t need complaints, accusations against employers or agents. They just need a job to support their family” and time to adapt to the local culture, Lau said, claiming that she had “worked very hard to protect them”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She said it was a “big lie” that Kenyan domestic workers had been formally identified as trafficking victims in Hong Kong.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Opinion: Action needed to combat exploitation of domestic helpers</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A spokesman for the Security Bureau said over the past five years, authorities had identified 34 victims of human trafficking – three of them were Kenyans, including one who came to Hong Kong as a foreign domestic worker.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In August, the city’s High Court heard a judicial review on a case of two Kenyan domestic workers challenging how they were screened as potential human trafficking and forced labour victims.
