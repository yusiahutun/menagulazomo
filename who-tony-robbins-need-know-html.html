Mahavoric on February 29, 1960 in North Hollywood, California, Tony was brought up by his mother, who married a few times, including to semi-professional baseball player Jim Robbins, who legally adopted Tony when he was 12.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>During his childhood, he worked as a handyman to support his siblings and when he was 17, left an abusive home and worked as a janitor for a short time.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Tony also promoted seminars for the motivational speaker Jim Rohn at this age and after meeting Neurolinguistic Programming co-founder John Grinder in the 1980s, they partnered after he learned about Ericksonian hypnosis and NLP. He also learned how to firewalk.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 1988, Tony’s first infomercial was released, advertising his services as a performance coach which went on to help sales of his self-help audiotapes.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By 1997, he started his Leadership Academy seminar and after gaining widespread success, spoke at the 2007 TED conference, which is ranked one of the Top 10 TED Talks of all time.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He went on launch the Robbins-Madanes Center for Intervention in partnership with Cloe Madanes and in 2014, acquired rights to launch a Major League Soccer franchise in Los Angeles with Magic Johnson, Mia Hamm and Peter Guber.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Tony has also partnered with Golden State Warriors co-owner Peter Guber to purchase the eSports pro-gaming organisation Team Liquid alongside Ted Leonsis, the co-owner of the Washington Wizards.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Named one of the top 50 Business Intellectuals by Accenture, Tony Robbins is also listed on Harvard Business Press’ Top 200 Business Gurus and on Forbes’ Celebrity 100.</p><img id=i-74e5494c55f5f423 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/09/15/4AEF21B200000578-5594935-Tony_Robbins_is_listed_on_Harvard_s_Top_200_Business_Gurus_and_o-a-48_1523283542693.jpg height=442 width=634 alt="Tony Robbins is listed on Harvard's Top 200 Business Gurus and on Forbes’ Celebrity 100" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Tony Robbins is listed on Harvard's Top 200 Business Gurus and on Forbes’ Celebrity 100</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">Who is Tony Robbins’s wife?</h2><p class=mol-para-with-font>Tony’s first wife was Rebecca Jenkins who he married in 1984 after meeting at a seminar. She had three children from two former marriages, whom Tony adopted. They filed for divorce in 1998.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He also fathered a child with former girlfriend Liz Acosta in 1984 and their son, Jairek Robbins, is now a personal empowerment trainer.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Tony married Bonnie Sage Humphrey in 2001 and the couple reside in Palm Beach, <a style=font-weight:700 class=class href=#>Florida</a>.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">What is Tony Robbins’s net worth?</h2><p class=mol-para-with-font>Tony Robbins has accumulated a net worth of approximately <span class=mol-style-bold>$500 million (£389m)</span>, according to <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">How did Tony Robbins make his money?</h2><p class=mol-para-with-font>Tony has built a lucrative career from helping other people lead successful lives and industry giants are <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>rumoured</a> to pay upwards of seven figures for his services.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>General admission to his events can cost thousands; the Unleash The Power Within event in 2017 sold tickets between $650 (£459) and $2,995 (£2,117). Tony consults more than 200,000 every year, but his businesses are where he makes the most money.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He is the chairman of a holding company that is comprised of a dozen businesses that sees annual sales of more than $5 billion (£3.5bn), is a partner of America’s Best 401k which consults businesses on their 401k services, and founded Global Accounting Alliance, which provides outsourced CFO services.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On top of this, his books, audio and video programmes have been sold all over the world and have been distributed across 100 countries, which is sure to have brought in a lot of cash.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, Tony has donated millions to charity and established the Anthony Robbins Foundation in 1991 to help those in the inner-city.

In conversation with Nadine McCool, Tony tried to use the movement to express his views on the subject of ‘victimhood’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘If you use the #MeToo movement to try to get significance and certainty by attacking and destroying someone else, you haven’t grown an ounce. All you’ve done is basically use a drug called significance to make yourself feel good,' Tony said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Nadine called out the life coach and said that he was ‘mischaracterising the movement’ and Tony stated that he is not against #MeToo. ‘Who should throw the stone? You shouldn’t throw that stone if you live in a f****** glass house.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Is there any one of us that hasn’t done something that we prefer we’d not or that we’re embarrassed by or that was hurtful even if we didn’t intend it to?’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Nadine McCool said: ‘Certainly there are people who are using it for their own personal devices, but there are also a significant number of people who are using it not to relive whatever may have happened to them, but to make it safe for the young women. So that they don’t have to feel unsafe.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She goes on to call Tony’s view of #MeToo a ‘disservice’ and Tony walked towards her to push his fist into hers. He continued to say, ‘When you push someone else, it doesn’t make you more safe. It just makes them angry’, and shared a story about a ‘very famous man, very powerful man’ who refused to hire a woman because of her good looks.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Tony’s comments resulted in backlash on <a style=font-weight:700 class=class href=#>Twitter</a> and even #MeToo founder Tarana Burke voiced her disapproval after the video was circulated.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I was made aware of this video BEFORE I ever saw it because Tony Robbins people reached out to do damage control within 24 hours. They wanted to 'give me context' apparently. I don't need any. I have eyes. The full video is 11 mins. And it's gross. Bravo to this woman.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Oh the video is MUCH worse. His misogyny runs deep. To even repeat that story of his "friend" who wouldn't hire the "pretty woman" as if it's the MOVEMENT's fault and not the sexist man's fault is all you need to hear. It's deplorable. But SO many folks misunderstand this work.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'And he is clear that he won't apologize so it is what it is. If you choose to keep supporting him it's with full knowledge of his views on women and survivors. This moment is so damaging, especially with how influential @TonyRobbins is.
