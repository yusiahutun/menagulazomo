That means anyone in the market for a Switch controller will have to wade through hundreds of products—which often results in the best choices getting buried below a pile of third-party knockoffs.</p><p>To further complicate matters, many manufacturers have launched gamepads inspired by previous generations of Nintendo consoles. Take a quick look at any reputable retailer, and you'll see Switch gamepads that look like iconic controllers for GameCube, N64, SNES, and NES. Toss in the availability of fighting sticks, racing wheels, and other auxiliary peripherals, and it's easy to get overwhelmed by your options.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The best way to narrow down your Nintendo Switch controller search is to determine which type of gamepad best fits your play style. Do you mostly play classic games through Switch Online? Consider looking at retro controllers. Are you a fighting game enthusiast? A fight stick or customizable gamepad are good options. If you can't decide, stick with most Pro-style controllers' traditional layout.</p><p>After establishing the type of controller best for your play style, you'll need to figure out your budget. Controllers nowadays come with all sorts of price tags. Wired controllers are typically cheaper than their wireless counterparts, and first-party products from Nintendo are typically among the most expensive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nintendo products are always an easy recommendation, but if you're shopping on a budget, consider checking out reputable third-party brands such as PowerA, HORI, and PDP. That's not to say that other manufacturers are putting out subpar products—but you'll need to do a bit more legwork before scooping up anything from a lesser-known company.</p><p>If that all seems a bit daunting, we've compiled a list of the best Switch controllers available today. Whether you're shopping for a budget gamepad or a premium controller for fighting games, something below is bound to fit your needs.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><td colspan=3 style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p><strong>How Did We Research</strong></p></td></tr><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Models Evaluated</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Hours Researched</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Reviews Analyzed</p></td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>22</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>7</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>25</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>How-To Geek's product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

Built with an ergonomic design that's great for extended play sessions and boasting some premium face buttons and analog sticks, few products come close to rivaling its performance.</p><p>Not only is it built with high-end components, but it supports various useful features not found in lesser gamepads. This includes motion controls, HD rumble, and amiibo support. Its wireless connection lets you quickly sync the device with your console—and it can even be used on a PC if you have a gaming rig.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The main drawback of the Switch Pro Controller is the lack of a headphone jack. That's a minor nitpick when you consider everything else the gamepad offers, but no doubt it's a bit of an oversight from Nintendo. Look past that, however, and you'll be treated to one of the best Switch controllers money can buy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/powera-controller.png> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>Nintendo Switch Pro Controller</h5><span>Best Switch Controller Overall</span><p class=display-card-description>As a first-party product, it should come as no surprise that the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller offers incredible performance, an ergonomic design, and support for motion controls and HD rumble.</p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Amazon</a><h2 id=best-budget-switch-controller-voyee-wireless-controller>Best Budget Switch Controller: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">VOYEE Wireless Controller</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pdp-switch-controller.png><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th><p>Pros</p></th><th><p>Cons</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>16 programmable buttons</p></td><td><p>Battery life can't match the official controller</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Same size and shape as the official gamepad</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Four different HD rumble settings</p></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Who says you need to spend upwards of sixty bucks to get a good-quality Switch controller? Coming in at less than $23, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">VOYEE Wireless Switch Controller</a> punches well above the weight implied by the price and even includes a few features the official controller can't match.</p><p>The VOYEE controller uses the same ergonomic shape as Nintendo's own version, and although it's a couple of ounces lighter, the difference is hard to feel. The color is also the same, favoring an all-black design rather than the "funky" colored plastic used on many third-party gamepads. It does have multicolored LEDs around the two joysticks, but these can be switched off if they aren't your thing.</p><p>The controller features 18 buttons in total, 16 of which are programmable and include two extra triggers on the back. One of these additional controls is the Turbo button, which enables burst mode on one of the four main buttons. That means no more button-bashing. Instead, you can simply hold the button down, and it will activate a set number of times.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The only area where the VOYEE controller can't match the official gamepad is the battery. The 800mAh cell should give you 12–15 hours of play before it needs to be charged. That isn't terrible, but it's significantly less than the 40+ hours the Nintendo Pro controller provides.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pdp-controller.png> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>VOYEE Switch Controller</h5><span>Best Budget Switch Controller</span><p class=display-card-description>At under $25, the VOYEE Switch controller proves you don't have to spend a fortune to get a good-quality, programmable, wireless gamepad for your Nintendo console.&nbsp;</p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">$16 at Amazon</a><h2 id=best-third-party-switch-controller-powera-enhanced-switch-controller>Best Third Party Switch Controller: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">PowerA Enhanced Switch Controller</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/powera-gamecube-controller.jpg><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th><p>Pros</p></th><th><p>Cons</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Rear triggers can be remapped on the fly</p></td><td><p>Costs almost the same as the official controller</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Excellent build quality</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Available in several different designs</p></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The reasons to choose a third-party controller over the official Nintendo Switch Pro controller are often price or extra features. While the wireless <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">PowerA Enhanced controller</a> doesn't cost much less than the Nintendo gamepad when it isn't on sale, it does feature additional controls and is exceptionally well-made.</p><p>The PowerA Enhanced controller is almost exactly the same size and shape as the official controller. The core button layout is also identical, meaning there's nothing new to learn if you're used to Nintendo's gamepad.</p><p>A cool metallic D-pad adds a bit of flair to the black version. If the shiny D-pad isn't enough, several Nintendo-themed versions are also available for a more distinctive controller style.</p><p>There are a couple of extras on the back of the controller: two extra trigger buttons and a program button that lets you change their use on the fly. The final bonus feature is an LED player indicator light, letting you know which gamepad is which in multiplayer games.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>PowerA controllers have a great reputation, with the company producing some of the best third-party controllers for a variety of consoles.

There are several good wired gamepads available in a variety of styles, but our favorite is the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Rematch Enhanced controller</a> from PDP.</p><p>The officially licensed PDP Enhanced is a well-made and ergonomically designed controller, available in 19 different decorative styles. The designs are all game-related, featuring Mario, Zelda, and Animal Crossing characters, among several others. If you're not a fan of the character-based styles, there are a few more subtle designs available.</p><p>The benefit of official licensing doesn't stop at the decorative elements. It also means that the gamepad has been tested and approved by Nintendo, ensuring everything works as it should with the Switch. That does make the PDP Rematch Enhanced a bit more expensive than some other wired controllers, but it's a small price for extra peace of mind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are very few additional bells and whistles, aside from a couple of "Pro" paddles on the back and the ability to remap the controls. The gamepad has a built-in 3.5mm headphone jack, something you don't often see on Switch controllers, and the 10ft (3 meters) cable gives you a decent amount of freedom to move around while playing, and you aren't forced to sit too close to the screen.</p><p>The PDP Rematch Enhanced controller might not have the extra buttons and LEDs of something like the VOYEE gamepad, but if you want a wired Switch controller, it's one of the best around.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/8bitdo-arcade-stick-controller.png> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>PDP REMATCH Wired Controller for Nintendo Switch</h5><span>Best Wired Switch Controller</span>$18 <span class=regular-price>$28</span> Save $10<p class=display-card-description>The game-related designs might not be to everyone's taste, but there's no denying that the PDP Rematch wired controller is a cost-effective and very capable device.
