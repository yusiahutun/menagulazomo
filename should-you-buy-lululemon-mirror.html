These devices let you see yourself during a workout, while also allowing you to interact with a touchscreen interface. Lululemon, a popular fitness fashion brand, has its own version of this device, simply known as Mirror.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In September 2023, the company decided to nix sales of the device over the following months and stick to clothing and accessories. So, what does this mean for Lululemon users, and should you still consider buying a Mirror?</p><h2 id=what-is-a-lululemon-mirror>What Is a Lululemon Mirror?</h2><p>Fitness mirrors are a little niche, but home fitness gear is incredibly popular. And many brands are taking things a step further than your average treadmill or bench press.</p><p>You've probably seen brands like Peloton offering fitness hardware combined with online classes run by professional fitness instructors. <a href=#>A fitness mirror is a smart device</a> that lets you view your posture, follow workouts, and gain real-time feedback on how you're performing. The Lululemon Mirror offers users access to over 10,000 workout classes. This even includes live workout classes with professional trainers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But Mirror isn't the brainchild of Lululemon. In fact, Lululemon acquired Mirror, which was a fitness startup at the time, for $500 million in 2020. Mirror had already created its home workout hardware that lets users view themselves during interactive workouts. But with Lululemon's acquisition, the product could be pushed into the fitness mainstream.</p><p>The Mirror ran for five years, but maintaining a profit with the high up-front price and monthly fee became a struggle after the COVID-19 pandemic began to ease and people could head back to the gym or outdoors to exercise again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a result of this struggle, Lululemon decided to sign a content deal with Peloton. The two companies have partnered up, with Peloton offering Mirror users its own hub of workout content. The Mirror Studio app will slowly be phased out during this transition.</p><p>The case has been the same for a lot of home fitness brands. Peloton, for instance, went through multiple rounds of layoffs in 2022, affecting thousands of employees. One round of redundancies cut 12 percent of Peloton's workforce.</p><h2 id=should-you-buy-the-lululemon-mirror>Should You Buy the Lululemon Mirror?</h2><p>The Lululemon Mirror costs a cool $1,500 and requires a $39 monthly subscription, so it's no small purchase. That's why it's important to know if you truly need one of these devices. But features and price aren't the only thing to consider here.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Lululemon Mirror's availability will also be taking a big hit once hardware sales cease. Although you won't be able to buy new devices from retailers once stock runs out, there will likely be opportunities to buy the secondhand Mirror devices. However, resale prices could be even higher than the original price if demand is high.</p><p>In short, it probably isn't a good idea to buy the Lululemon Mirror in 2023. Given the company's decision to pull the Mirror from online stores and stop access to its <a href=#>smartphone fitness app</a> for new users at the end of the year, it seems pretty moot to grab yourself a Mirror at this point.</p><p>However, if you're still thinking of getting a Lululemon Mirror, note that Studio app access will begin to be cut off to new users at the start of November 2023, so you don't have very long to grab your Mirror and join.</p><p>If you already have a Lululemon Mirror, don't worry. You'll still be able to access the app even after newcomers can no longer use it, so long as you've already signed up for an account. Meanwhile, f you've recently bought a Lululemon Mirror but weren't aware of this big change, the company still offers 30-day returns.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lululemon-mirror-alternatives>Lululemon Mirror Alternatives</h2><p>If you're still looking for a fitness mirror but want to steer clear of the Lululemon Mirror, there are some great alternatives you can consider.</p><h3 id=forme-studio>1. FORME Studio</h3><p>The FORME Studio fitness mirror is similar to the Lululemon Mirror in that it allows you to take part in interactive workouts, receive feedback, and keep an eye on your posture. Upon signup, you'll be provided with your own personal trainer who will be selected based on your goals and preferences. This personalized approach is great for those who don't really know what kind of workouts are best for them and adds a human touch to a remote experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The FORME Studio also offers mindfulness classes for when you want to relax or cool down after a workout. However, it's important to note that this would make for a very costly purchase. The device itself comes in at $2,495, while the membership also costs a hefty $149 monthly (though your first month will only cost $49).</p><p>Unlike other fitness mirrors, you also can't listen to your choice of music while working out. If you need your own tunes to get in the zone, the FORME Studio may not be for you. If you're more interested in weight training over cardio, you may prefer the FORME Lift, a fitness mirror with a weight extension.</p><h3 id=tonal>2. Tonal</h3><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tonal is another sleek fitness mirror that's especially great for weightlifting. The mirror has a weight extension that you can use to tone up, while also providing access to cardio workouts and massage sessions (using a Theragun device). All in all, the Tonal mirror gives users access to over 1,000 classes, so you certainly won't be short of choice.</p><p>The Tonal mirror costs $3,495 and also requires a $59.95 monthly subscription to access workouts. If you want to grab Tonal's smart accessories, there will also be an additional cost. The smart accessories bundle costs an extra $495, so you'll be spending a lot of money if you want to use the Tonal mirror to its full potential.</p><h2 id=the-lululemon-mirror-may-soon-be-a-thing-of-the-past>The Lululemon Mirror May Soon Be a Thing of the Past</h2><p>While you can still use the Lululemon Mirror if you already own the device, it's wise to avoid buying yourself one right now. Given the slow phasing out of the Mirror and its Studio app, you're better off opting for a smart mirror that is still fully functional for both new and existing customers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiqoaelobFuxc6uZJutqWK5trjUpZymp55iuqq%2B0aipaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
