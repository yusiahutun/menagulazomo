We will continue to work together as parents to always ensure they receive the love and attention they deserve. “We arrived at this decision to end our marriage after much consideration. Doing so is, of course painful, and difficult, like it is for so many people who go through the same thing everyday around the world.

In a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Vanity Fair</a> interview in 2009, Gisele opened up about how she met Tom. “I knew right way — the first time I saw him,” she recalled.&nbsp;“We met through a friend. The moment I saw him, he smiled and I was like, ‘That is the most beautiful, charismatic smile I’ve ever seen!’ We sat and talked for three hours. I had to go home for Christmas, but I didn’t want to leave. You know that feeling of, like, you can’t get enough? From the first day we met, we’ve never spent one day without speaking to each other.”</p><p>The two married in 2009 after three years of dating. When Tom’s ex Bridget Moynahan was pregnant with Tom’s baby while she was in a relationship with him, she recalled in her memoir, “Two months into our relationship, Tom told me that his ex-girlfriend was pregnant. The very next day, the news was everywhere and I felt my world had been turned upside down,” she also wrote that it “wasn’t an easy time” for her. But rest assured, she loved his child so much and wrote, “[He made] my heart expand in ways I didn’t know was possible.”</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Tom and Gisele got engaged in January 2009 and married a month later in February. They welcomed their <a href=#><span class=s2>first child</span></a> together, son Benjamin Rein, in 2009. Their second child, daughter Vivian Lake, was born in 2012. A source confirmed to <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2>People</span></a> in September 2022 that there’s been “a lot of tension” between Tom and Gisele since his decision to unretire. “There’s a lot of tension. She was so happy when he announced his retirement, and she wasn’t thrilled at all when he went back on that,” the insider said. “They’re hitting a rough patch. But I know they’re trying, or at least he’s trying, to figure it out and make it work. He wants to get through this and for things to get better.” The couple subsequently filed for divorce on October 28, 2022.</span></p><p>After Tom announced his retirement from professional football in January 2023, he honored his ex-wife with a series of photos on his Instagram Story of him, Gisele and their kids, Benjamin and Vivian. One picture showed Gisele walking through a football stadium with their kids dressed in Tampa Bay Buccaneers merch. In January 2023, Tom announced that his second retirement from football and confirmed he was leaving the sport “for good.” “I’m retiring. For good. I know the process was a pretty big deal last time, so when I woke up this morning I figured I’d just press record, and let you guys know first,” he said in an Instagram video. “It won’t be long-winded, you only get one super-emotional retirement essay, and I used mine up last year, so. I…really thank you guys…so much. To every single one of you, for supporting me, my family, my friends, teammates, my competitors. I could go on forever. There’s too many. Thank you guys for allowing me to live my absolute dream. I wouldn’t change a thing.

His friends want to set him up, but he’s all about the kids,”&nbsp; the source dished. The source continued, “Brady gave everything he had to his final NFL season, but now he’s ready to give everything to his family and his new life. His kids ultimately were the reason why he made this decision. He never thought that he and Gisele would get divorced. He didn’t want a divorce.”</p><p><span>Sources also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TMZ</a> that Tom isn’t worried about dating after his retirement and divorce. His complete focus will be devoted to spending the next few months just being a dad. The outlet reports that he’s splitting his time with his kids in Miami and New York. His firstborn son, John “Jack” he has with ex-Bridget Moynahan, plays football in New York City and Tom regularly flies privately to see him play. Tom was also recently spotted alone, scoping out schools in the Miami area for his kids he shares with Gisele— Benjamin and Vivian.</span></p><h2>Bridget Moynahan (2004 – 2006)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/bridget-moynahan-tom-brady.jpg><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Tom Brady started dating actress <a href=# rel=noopener>Bridget Moynahan</a> in early 2004 after Tom won his second Super Bowl for the New England Patriots and Bridget starred on the hit show Sex and the City. Together, they attended the 2006 Met Gala and the Vanity Fair Oscar Awards party. In a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">60 Minutes</a> interview, Tom revealed what Bridget meant to him in his relationship. “She’s helped a lot,” he said fondly. “I can be myself around her, and there’s not many people I can be myself around. It’s fun to be around your best friends who know you well, and she’s someone that I consider one of my very best friends.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The two ended their relationship in December 2006. A rep told People at the time, “(They) amicably ended their three-year relationship several weeks ago. We ask for your respect and consideration of their privacy. No further comments will be made.” Three months later, Bridget was expecting Tom’s baby. “Bridget is over three months pregnant,” her rep&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>said</a>. “Former boyfriend Tom Brady is the father.” At the time, Tom started to date Gisele Bündchen. Bridget gave birth to John “Jack” Edward Moynahan in August 2007.</p><p class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Blue Bloods actress opened up about her complicated pregnancy with Tom’s baby. “[Tom] was there on that day and came in afterwards,” she told&nbsp;More magazine in 2011 about her labor. “He certainly wasn’t holding my hand while I pushed.” In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Harper’s Bazaar,</a> she also revealed how her mental health was affected during the time. “Going through that traumatic time of being heartbroken and then being pregnant turned my whole life upside down and inside out and just knocked the wind out of me,” she told the magazine. “But I got so much out of that … Now I have a child, and it’s the best thing in the world.” She continued, “I’m not sure anyone — and I could be wrong in this — grows up thinking, ‘I want to be a single mom’ … Doing it on your own when it wasn’t expected comes with a lot of fears and anxieties. But I felt 100 percent that I could do this.”</p><p>In the same More magazine interview, Bridget explained how she kept a blended family with Gisele and Tom. “I never made a comment about Gisele or Tom publicly,” she explained to the outlet. “I have a relationship with these people on a daily basis. I’m raising a child, and it’s public. The media creates these dramas, and that’s not what’s happening in my life. My son has two loving parents and an extended family, whether it’s cousins or stepmothers or boyfriends. My son is surrounded by love.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-125 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During an appearance on the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Howard Stern Show</a> in April 2020, Tom confessed how he felt when he found out that Bridget was pregnant. “Next thing you know, I found out that Bridget was pregnant with our son,” he said. “So that was a very unique time … and it challenged me in a lot of ways, again, to grow up in a different way. And it was very challenging for my son’s mom, you know, because she didn’t envision that either.”</p><p>Tom and Bridget continue to have an amicable relationship, with the John Wick actress congratulating her ex-boyfriend on his Super Bowl wins and supporting their kid in his dream of becoming a professional athlete. After Tom announced his retirement from professional football in January 2023, he honored his ex-girlfriend with a rare photo on his Instagram Story of him, Bridget and Jack. The picture showed the trio dressed in button-down shirts, with Brady and Jack just in their socks while Bridget wore flip-flops.</p><h2>Gisele Bündchen (2006 – 2022)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/irina-shayk.jpg><p>Tom started to date Gisele Bündchen in December 2006, shortly after his public breakup with Bridget Moynahan.
