The Game of Thrones-type series got a few lesser stars than it anticipated after the first three of the six episodes premiered on 19 November 2021. The others, especially the fantasy fans, still recognized it for its massively mounted scale, lavish sets, lush costumes, attention to detail, strong cast, a rich, fantastical world, mature themes, and (of course) Rosamund Pike in the lead."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The others, especially the fantasy fans, still recognized it for its massively mounted scale, lavish sets, lush costumes, attention to detail, strong cast, a rich, fantastical world, mature themes, and (of course) Rosamund Pike in the lead.</p><p>Now, in the rest of the writing, meet Josha Stradowski, who is also among this season’s main cast.</p><h3><strong>Josha Stradowski On The Wheel Of Time</strong></h3><p>Josha plays the character Rand al’Thor from Robert Jordan’s novel series of the same name: The Wheel of Time. Recently, he also admitted that he has become an avid reader of The Wheel of Time books.</p><p>So, Josha’s character is a motherless distant relative of Moiraine Damodred who can also wield magic.</p><p>Sadly, in a review by Guardian writer critique-ly wrote that Josha’s character has no distinguishing characteristics apart from wearing a mohair jumper “I’m sure I had in 1987 and being the prettiest of all the Meyers-Phillippe offspring.”</p><p>Nevertheless, Josha seemed impressed with his “fresh” looking dude, i.e, Rand, as he kept promoting its recent launch on social media.</p><p>Also, speaking to Metro.co.uk at the London premiere of the Amazon Prime Video saga, he discussed Rand’s progression throughout the series — going from being a humble farm boy in a village called the Two Rivers to embarking on a dangerous quest with Moiraine and his friends.</p><p>Then, when asked what he thinks of the comparisons being made between his show and the Game of Thrones, he said:</p><p>“I guess I take it as a compliment. To be fair, I haven’t seen Game of Thrones, so there’s not much I can say about that.”</p><p>At a certain fest in Ireland, Josha met casting director Kelly Valentine Hendry who, several months later, had asked him to audition for The Wheel of Time.</p><p>For someone who has never worked in such a big production in his life before, the Amazon series is going to be a game-changer.</p><h3><strong>Josha Stradowski Race: What Is His Parents Ethnicity?</strong></h3><p>Josha Stradowski acquired a blend of Dutch and Polish descent from his parents.

The film, seen as the first Dutch gay romantic comedy, won the Audience Award in the category of “best film” at the Perth International Queer Film Festival.</p><p>So, Josha’s convincing/award-winning portrayal of his part in the film was the reason why fans wanted to know if Josha is also gay in real life.</p><p>This does not seem to be the case though. Josha never hinted at anything as such.</p><h3><strong>Does Josha Stradowski Have A Girlfriend?</strong></h3><p>Josha had not revealed his relationship status as of November 2021.
