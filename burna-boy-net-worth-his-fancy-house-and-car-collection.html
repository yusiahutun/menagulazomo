Besides his music career, Burna Boy makes money through live performances, endorsements, and other endeavors.</strong></p><p><span>Burna Boy is one of Africa’s most valuable export to the world as far as music is concerned. The Grammy Award-winning singer has been enjoying an incredible music career, through which he has engraved his names in people’s hearts with his many hit singles and albums. To this effect, he has also raised for himself a whopping net worth of $17 million. Burna Boy’s net worth has undoubtedly earned him a worthy position among the richest young music artists in Nigeria and the entire African continent.</span></p><p>Burna Boy’s fast rise in the music industry and his compelling net worth have attracted the preying eyes of many who wonder how he pulled such massive financial weight in a short time. <span>The singer is regarded as one of the few Nigerian artists with many talents. Hence, he can improve his net worth via many sources. Here’s a breakdown of how the Kilometre-crooner realized his jaw-dropping net worth.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=burna-boys-music-career-is-his-major-source-of-income></span><b>Burna Boy’s Music Career is His Major Source of Income</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nigeria’s music industry is one of the fast-rising industries in the anti-African continent. As a major contributor to youth employment and empowerment, its current value doesn’t only represent “food for the soul’’ but also “food for the pocket.” Luckily, the likes of Burna Boy have leveraged the industry to their own benefit.&nbsp;<span>Unlike 2face, Timaya, and P-Square, who broke out from their averagely poor background to the amazing fame they currently enjoy, Burna Boy’s family played a great role in his career choice.</span></p><p><span>His passion for music is something he got from his parents and family in general. His grandfather Benson Idonije did manage the legendary Nigerian singer Fela Anukulapo Ransome Kuti, whom he grew up to love and emulate his songs and music style. His interest in the music genre grew further when he relocated with his parents to Lagos, Nigeria. While he was at Corona Secondary School, Agbara, Lagos State, he decided to pursue his dream in music.</span></p><p><span>After completing his secondary education, his parents enrolled him in a school in the UK, but he dropped out to return to Nigeria, where he began his music career. Since his break into the Nigerian music industry in 2010, he has released </span>five projects<span> with countless hits.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=he-launched-his-professional-music-career-in-2012></span><strong>He Launched His Professional Music Career in 2012</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>In 2012, he made his much-anticipated introduction into the Nigerian music industry, dropping hit songs such as </span><i><span>Like to Party</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Yawa Dey</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Run My Race, </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Tonight</span></i><span>. The songs were also included in his first album </span><i><span>L.I.F.E</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Almost a decade since his debut as a local artist, Burna Boy has propelled himself into becoming a successful international artiste, collaborating with top international artists such as Diddy, Sia, Major Lazer, Beyonce, DJ Snake, Pop Smoke, Sam Smith, Justin Bieber, Ed Sheeran, Stormzy and more. He has also collaborated with other internationally recognized African artists such as 2Baba, Wizkid, AKA, DJ Spinall, Dbanj, Sarkodie, Sauti Sol, Master KG, and others.</span></p><p><span>His talent and good music could hardly go unrecognized both within the shores of Africa and overseas, earning him accolades from top award organizers such as the Grammy Awards, BET Awards, MOBO Awards, MTV Europe Music Awards, AFRIMMA, MTV Africa Music Awards, The Headies, Soundcity MVP Awards Festival, All Africa Music Awards, among many others. He even became the </span>first Nigerian artist in the UK to have his song certified silver after his “African Giant” album was certified silver. This means that the album sold over 60,000 copies. The song ‘Own It’ featuring him and Ed Sheeran has a two-time platinum certification for selling 600,000 copies.</p><p><span>The exact amount Burna Boy makes from each of his hit songs and albums is unknown, but from his debut album </span>studio album <i>L.I.F.E,</i> which sold 40,000 copies on the first day of its release on 12 August 2013, down to&nbsp;<i>Outside, </i>his third studio album, which had a fusion of mostly afrobeat, dancehall, reggae and road rap, and his 4-track collaborative EP, which blended his upbeat melodies with DJDS’ slinky trap beats, we could say without doubts that the singer has a master craft strategy on how to make music work for him.</p><p>Burna Boy is just a few years old in the music industry, but he has released five studio albums, two mixtapes, and two EPs, and he has succeeded in making the Afrobeats sound global.</p><p><strong>His top-selling albums will include:</strong></p><ul><li><i><span>L.I.F.E </span></i><span>(2013)</span></li><li><i><span>On a Spaceship </span></i><span>(2015)</span></li><li><i><span>Outside </span></i><span>(2018)</span></li><li><i><span>African Giant</span></i><span> (2019)</span></li><li><i><span>Twice as Tall</span></i><span> (2020)</span></li></ul><p>In addition to making successful music albums, the multi-award-winning Afrobeat singer has also received accolades for his hit singles. Some of his singles are rated among the best-selling singles in the music world. A good example is his 2018 single “On The Low,’’ which earned him a gold plaque after selling 100,000 (or more) copies.</p><p><strong>Burna Boy’s hit singles include the following:</strong></p><ul><li>On the Low <span>(2018)</span></li><li><i><span>Killin</span></i> <i><span>Dem </span></i><span>(2018)</span></li><li><i><span>Anybody </span></i><span>(2019)</span></li><li><i><span>Like to Party</span></i> <span>(2012)</span></li><li><i><span>Tonight </span></i><span>(2012)</span></li><li><i><span>Run my Race</span></i> <span>(2013)</span></li><li><i><span>Yawa Dey </span></i><span>(2013)</span></li><li><i><span>Won Da Mo </span></i><span>(2013)</span></li><li><i><span>Don Gorgon </span></i><span>(2014)</span></li><li><i><span>Dangote </span></i><span>(2019)</span></li><li><i><span>Check and Balance</span></i><span> (2014)</span></li><li><i><span>Heaven’s Gate </span></i><span>(2017)</span></li><li><i><span>Ye</span></i><span> (2017)</span></li><li><i><span>Gbona </span></i><span>(2018)</span></li><li><i><span>Odogwu </span></i><span>(2020)</span></li><li><i><span>Wonderful </span></i><span>(2020)</span></li><li><i><span>Monsters You Made </span></i><span>(2020)</span></li><li><i><span>Real Life </span></i><span>(2020)</span></li><li><i><span>Way too Big </span></i><span>(2020)</span></li><li><i><span>Kilometer </span></i><span>(2021)</span></li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=his-best-featured-songs-include></span><strong>His best-featured Songs include&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li><span>AKA – </span><i><span>All Eyes on Me </span></i><span>(2014)</span></li><li><span>Sarkodie – </span><i><span>Special Someone </span></i><span>(2014)</span></li><li><span>Larry Gaaga – </span><i><span>Baba Nla </span></i><span>(2018)</span></li><li><span>Major Lazer – </span><i><span>All My Life </span></i><span>(2018)</span></li><li><span>Sauti Sol – </span><i><span>Afrikan Star </span></i><span>(2019)</span></li><li><span>Dave – </span><i><span>Location</span></i><span> (2019)</span></li><li><span>Beyonce – </span><i><span>Ja Ara E </span></i><span>(2019)</span></li><li><span>DJ Snake – </span><i><span>No Option </span></i><span>(2019)</span></li><li><span>Stormzy, Ed Sheeran – </span><i><span>Own It </span></i><span>(2019)</span></li><li><span>2Baba – </span><i><span>We Must Groove </span></i><span>(2020)</span></li><li><span>Pop Smoke – </span><i><span>Enjoy Yourself </span></i><span>(2020)</span></li><li><span>Master KG – </span><i><span>Jerusalema remix</span></i><span> (2020)</span></li><li><span>Sam Smith – </span><i><span>My Oasis </span></i><span>(2020)</span></li><li><span>Wizkid – </span><i><span>Ginger </span></i><span>(2020)</span></li><li><span>Sia – </span><i><span>Hey Boy </span></i><span>(2021)</span></li><li><span>Justin Bieber – </span><i><span>Loved by You</span></i><span> (2021)</span></li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=his-list-of-eps></span><strong>His list of Eps</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li><i><span>Redemption </span></i><span>(2016)</span></li><li><i><span>Steel & Copper </span></i><span><span>(2019)</span></span></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=burna-boy-also-makes-money-from-live-performances></span><strong>Burna Boy Also Makes Money From Live Performances</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Music artists make a huge income is through live performances, and Burna Boy is not left out among the top celebrities called to grace the stages of top events. Thanks to his ever-rising fame, he counts it as a privilege to appear in more stages than some of his peers in the music industry. The Afro Music star is said to charge around N10 to N15 million per show.</p><p>In 2019, his artistry saw him perform at the One Africa Music Festival held in New York. Two years later,&nbsp; in March 2021, he was among the artists that performed for the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards Premiere Ceremony broadcast. This is just one of the many notable events he has been featured in. In 2021, the Nigerian Afro-fusion rapper would play his first show ever at the Hollywood Bowl on Oct. 8 as part of his Space Drift World Tour. It is currently one of only three U.S. stops on the tour, which will see him perform in New York City and San Francisco. He would also be performing live at the Governors Ball, ONE Musicfest, Outside Lands, Parklife Festival, Primavera Sound Festival.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=other-ways-burna-boy-accrued-his-net-worth></span><strong>Other Ways Burna Boy Accrued His Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Burna Boy’s net worth of $17 million is also a product of many other business ventures outside his successful music career. The music star reportedly has about 1 billion Naira worth of investments ranging from treasury bills and fixed deposits to EU bonds with Standard Chartered Bank. This is quite expected, considering his rapid rise to fame and wealth.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=he-owns-a-fashion-line></span><strong>He owns a Fashion Line</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Owning a clothing line looks like a new business strategy for most Nigerian celebrities. We’ve seen stars like Rugged Man, Tiwa Savage, Olamide, Wizkid, Peter Okoye own either clothing line aside from their music career. Interestingly, Burna Boy has joined the league.</p><p>In October 2020, the African Giant, as he calls himself, launched a clothing line called Boohooman. He teamed up with UK-based online retailer boohooMAN to create an exclusive collection of high-fashion streetwear. The boohooMAN and Burna Boy capsule is reportedly an exclusive curation of hype streetwear, with a very sentimental part of Burna Boy’s world. This follows the artiste’s intention to bring a strong cultural reference to his Nigerian heritage. <span>Over a hundred of their outfit so far has a “B” logo customized on it as a show of BoohooMAN’s collaboration with the Odogwu-crooner.</span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=his-burna-bank-in-new-york></span><strong>His Burna Bank in New York</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Thanks to his partnership with Spotify, a Swedish digital music service provider, Burna Boy now owns his own bank in the buzzing city of New York.

It features a unique ATM, specially made to dispense Burna notes, which can be exchanged for album-related merchandise.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=burna-boys-net-worth-also-comes-from-endorsement-deals></span><b>Burna Boy’s Net Worth Also Comes from Endorsement Deals</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span>Brand endorsements are other good measures where Burna Boy’s net worth grows. With over 7 million followers on Instagram, 2 million on Twitter, and more on other social media platforms, there’s no doubt that Burna Boy is perfect for marketing companies’ brands. He is one of the hottest artists in Africa, and as </span><span>a merit of his fame both home and abroad, Burna Boy has worked with top brands from around the globe. One of his biggest deals signed to date is his deal with Standard Chartered Bank, where he also has an EU bond.</span></p><p>The African Giant crooner is currently the bank’s digital bank brand ambassador. This was unveiled in an event held at the bank’s headquarters in Victoria Island. His role will include promoting Standard Chartered Digital Bank in Nigeria by lending his voice and image rights through marketing and other engagements.
