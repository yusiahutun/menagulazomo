She was always flirtatious with George, but so were a lot of girls and he, of course, loved it. Then she and Eric broke up - Eric told her to leave - and she came to stay with us at Kinfauns<br>It was 1 January 1969, and George and I had seen in the new year at Cilla Black`s house. [...] We arrived home in good spirits but then everything went swiftly downhill. The French girl didn`t seem remotely upset with Eric and was uncomfortably close to George. Something was going on between them, and I questioned George. He told me my imagination was running away whit me, I was paranoid.<br>Soon i couldn`t stand it so I went to London [...]. Six days later George phoned me to say that the girl had gone and I went home".<br>Both George and Eric had said about it in interview, but they had never said this girl`s name.<br>Eric said: "The reason why I deprived him of the wife is that he had put out his hand to my girl first. I thought that I revenged it on him".<br>And George said: "The reason why he deprived me of the wife is that I deprived him of the girl first.
