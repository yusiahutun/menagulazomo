The information about his relation or beau has never made headlines in tabloids. However, there are many speculations made regarding his personal life and sexuality.</p><h2>Is David Married? Wife?</h2><p>The former broadcast journalist, David Venable is possibly unmarried. He has never disclosed about his relationship or marriage with anyone. However, we never know another facet of the story. Do you think David is secretly married and hiding information from the media? Have you ever spotted him with his wife?</p><p>Although David isn’t showing any interest in marriage, there are lots of girls who would love to marry him. His talent of cooking delicious food has made him earn huge girl fan following. Here are some of the tweets from those ladies who love him and want to be his wife.</p><p></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-191 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=191 style="margin-bottom:15px!important;max-width:970px;text-align:center!important;min-width:580px;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;border:0 solid #ddd!important;width:970px;margin-top:15px!important;margin-left:auto!important;line-height:0;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;margin-right:auto!important;display:block!important;padding:0;float:none!important;min-height:400px"></span>Well, looking at these proposals of his female fans we can say that David has created a big name for himself and his ladies fans would do anything to be his partner.</p><h2>Is David a Gay?&nbsp;Partner/Boyfriend?</h2><p>David’s stagnant love life has led people to make assumptions regarding his sexual orientation. He is neither spotted with any girl nor speaks about having someone in life. Therefore, people have started suspecting that David may be a gay. We also found some posts on twitter which hints that David is possibly a gay.</p><p></p><p>Well, if David is a gay than he must have a male partner in his life, isn’t it?&nbsp; However, we have never heard about his affair or boyfriend so far.
