The country star wrote 'Roots and Wings' especially for a series of Ram Trucks ads that will air across television, print, digital and social media. The campaign represents the next phase of a partnership between Lambert and Ram Trucks that was first announced in November of 2014.

The guys at Ram really made the lyrics come to life with the imagery and I hope it speaks to people the way it does to me."</p><p>“Miranda Lambert is a perfect partner for Ram,” adds Robert Hegbloom, President and Chief Executive Officer, Ram Brand, FCA – North America. “In our very first meeting we saw the connections between her core values and those of the Ram Truck brand -- common traits like hard working, determined, goal-oriented, tough and a driving purpose to perform brilliantly at the highest levels. She’s been around trucks her entire life, from being born on a farm to owning a ranch now, and she lives her life by her own rules just like so many of our Ram Truck owners.”</p><p><strong>You Think You Know Miranda Lambert?</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpqGilrulrYylmKaalafBbr7OqKusZZGjsW7DyKeerGWilrpuwNGumqSrXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
