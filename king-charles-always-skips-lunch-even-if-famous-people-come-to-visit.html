Since the death of Queen Elizabeth II in September 2022, King Charles has taken over the throne and has more responsibilities than ever. It’s not been an easy time for him leading up to the throne, with many chops and changes in the royal family, including the departure of his youngest, Prince Harry, and his wife Meghan."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s not been an easy time for him leading up to the throne, with many chops and changes in the royal family, including the departure of his youngest, <a href=#>Prince Harry</a>, and his wife Meghan. Despite the ups and downs, there’s one thing that’s always stayed the same in Charles’ life. His lunch, or lack of it.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-82789935-672x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-king-charles-daily-routine-doesn-t-include-lunch>King Charles’ daily routine doesn’t include lunch</h2><p>The King is said to be in good physical shape, and has spent “much of his time adhering to a short daily exercise regime developed for the Royal Canadian Airforce,” <a href=#>royal</a> author Robert Hardman<strong> </strong>writes in his book, Charles III: New King. New Court. The Inside Story.</p><p>The author claims the King has inherited an “iron self-discipline from his late parents when it comes to food and drink.”</p><p>However, the 75-year-old has apparently taken it “one step further, removing lunch from his daily routine,” the author says.</p><p>Although, this is “on the basis that it is superfluous if one has had a decent breakfast.” Although this works for the King and his daily routine, it has proved difficult for others at royal visits, which sometimes include <a href=#>celebrities</a>. However, Hardman states the King “is certainly not frugal when it comes to feeding his guests.”</p><p>If there is a formal lunch, Charles will sit down with everyone else, although one house guest said it can be “a bit disconcerting.”</p><p>“You can be seated next to him, your food arrives and you are expected to tuck in while he sits there with an empty plate. But he’s very nice about it.”</p><p>It looks like Charles has passed some of these habits down to <a href=#>Prince William</a>, who will reportedly never be seen <a href=#>eating at a public engagement</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-king-also-has-a-strict-breakfast-rule>The King also has a ‘strict’ breakfast rule</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-180302150-1024x683.jpg><p>A man of routine, it’s been reported the King also has the same thing for breakfast every day, which was portrayed on <a href=#>Netflix</a>‘s The Crown.</p><p>“He normally starts the day with some fruit for breakfast, often some plums from the garden that have been lightly poached. A little juice and some muesli to go with it,” former royal chef Darren McGrady <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> Delish.</p><p>It’s also been said the monarch carries his breakfast box around with him, containing special muesli and dried fruits.</p><p>When younger, William reportedly once told guests to stay well away from his dad’s “bird food”.
