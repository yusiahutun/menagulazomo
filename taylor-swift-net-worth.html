Swift came onto the music scene in June 2006 with her first single, “Tim McGraw,” from her debut self-titled album. The album, which peaked at number 5 on the Billboard 100, included country hits like “Teardrops on My Guitar,” “Our Song” and “Should’ve Said No,” but it wasn’t until Swift released her second album, Fearless, in November 2008 that she blew up into the megastar singer-songwriter we know today."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In 2009, Swift also won her first MTV Video Music Award in the Best Female Video category for “You Belong With Me.” (The moment was also the start of her feud with <a href=# rel=noopener>Kanye West</a>, who crashed her speech to state that Beyoncé deserved the award instead for “Single Ladies.”) After Fearless, Swift went on to release seven more albums—Speak Now, Red, 1989, Reputation, Lover, Folklore and Evermore—and win Album of the Year another time in 2016 for 1989. (She is nominated for Album of the Year again for Folklore at the 2021 Grammys.) In 2021, Swift released her first re-recorded albums,<a href=# rel=noopener> Fearless (Taylor’s Version)</a> and<a data-pmc-sp-product=36bd32847a7a54c3de21f70fd73f9fbf href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Red (Taylor’s Version)","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Red (Taylor&#39;s Version) [4 LP]","price":"40.99","id":"B09J99PKDF","category":"Pop"},"id":1197536,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow> Red (Taylor’s Version)</a> .</p><p>The re-recordings came after her former record label, Big Machine Records, and her former manager, Scott Borschetta, sold the rights to her music to music manager Scooter Braun (who works with artists like Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande) and his company, Ithaca Holdings. (More on that later.)</p><p>Despite her success, Swifties know that her career has been nothing short of a rollercoaster. Ahead is what we know about <a href=# id=auto-tag_taylor-swift data-tag=taylor-swift>Taylor Swift</a>‘s net worth and the many milestones she had to overcome to become the multi-millionaire she is today.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1989-taylor-swift.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-is-taylor-swift-s-drama-with-scooter-braun>What is Taylor Swift’s drama with Scooter Braun?</h2><p>In November 2018, Swift left her former record label, Big Machine Records, which she had been with for 12 years, and signed with Universal Music Group in a deal worth a reported $200 million. The deal, which also provided better terms for Universal artists on Spotify, allowed Swift to maintain ownership of the master recordings of any new music she recorded with Universal.</p><p>In June 2019, news broke that talent <a href=# rel=noopener>manager Scooter Braun</a>, whose clients include <a href=# rel=noopener>Justin Bieber</a> and Ariana Grande, had acquired the masters of Swift’s first six studio albums from Big Machine Records for <a href=# rel=noopener>$300 million</a>. After the news, Swift slammed Braun as an “<a href=# rel=noopener>incessant, manipulative bully</a>” on her social media, revealing that she had tried to buy her masters from Big Machine Records but couldn’t because of the label’s unfavorable conditions.</p><p>“For years I asked, pleaded for a chance to own my work. Instead I was given an opportunity to sign back up to Big Machine Records and ‘earn’ one album back at a time, one for every new one I turned in,” Swift wrote at the time. “I walked away because I knew once I signed that contract, Scott Borchetta would sell the label, thereby selling me and my future. I had to make the excruciating choice to leave behind my past. Music I wrote on my bedroom floor and videos I dreamed up and paid for from the money I earned playing in bars, then clubs, then arenas, then stadiums.”</p><p>She ended her statement, “Thankfully, I am now signed to a label that believes I should own anything I create. Thankfully, I left my past in Scott’s hands and not my future. And hopefully, young artists or kids with musical dreams will read this and learn about how to better protect themselves in a negotiation. You deserve to own the art you make.”</p><p>A year later, Swift announced her decision to re-record her first six albums—Taylor Swift, Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989 and Reputation—after she failed to buy back her masters again. Her first re-recorded album, <a href=# rel=noopener>Fearless (Taylor’s Version)</a>, was released April 2021. Her next re-recorded album, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Red (Taylor’s Version)</a>, debuted in November 2021. Swift released her first album with Universal Music Group, Lover, in 2019. The album was followed by two more releases, Folklore and Evermore, in 2020. “When I think back on the Fearless album and all that you turned it into, a completely involuntary smile creeps across my face,” Swift wrote on her social media after she announced the re-recording of Fearless. “This was the musical era in which so many inside jokes were created between us, so many hugs exchanged and hands touched, so many unbreakable bonds formed. So before I say anything else, let me just say that it was a real honor to get to be a teenager alongside you.”</p><p>She released her 10th album, Midnights, in 2022. “We lie awake in love and in fear, in turmoil and in tears. We stare at walls and drink until they speak back. We twist in our self-made cages and pray that we aren’t—right this minute—about to make some fateful life-altering mistake,” she wrote in an Instagram post at the time describing the theme of Midnights. “This is a collection of music written in the middle of the night, a journey through terrors and sweet dreams. The floors we pace and the demons we face. For all of us who have tossed and turned and decided to keep the lanterns lit and go searching—hoping that just maybe, when the clock strikes twelve…we’ll meet ourselves.” She continued, “Midnights, the stories of 13 sleepless nights scattered throughout my life, will be out October 21. Meet me at midnight.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/taylor-swift-evermore-album-cover.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-is-taylor-swift-s-net-worth>What is Taylor Swift’s net worth?</h2><p>The question we all want to know.
