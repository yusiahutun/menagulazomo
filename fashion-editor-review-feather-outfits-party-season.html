But feather accents can be incorporated into an array of outfits that can be worn for any occasion.

Though they're both statement trends, wearing all black helped the look remain sophisticated. I paired it with my <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored nofollow">metallic court heels from Next</a></span>. You can see I've actually layered sheer tights underneath my jeans -the extra warmth is a bonus, but I'm a fan of tights and heels in the winter because it makes the look more seamless from head to toe, as opposed to my pale feet breaking it up.</p><h2 data-gid=e5HkjxQrEt_ dir=ltr><strong data-gid=evSHZ7XgI7E>The Feather Jumper&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/2e8470a6b4a8-image00006.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/1fac4817ba31-image00009.jpg><p id=eeqlqP5hngK data-wc=114>Obsessed is not the word.

The Duchess of Sussex has been advocating for full winter white looks recently, and I'm totally on board. I paired this knit withhold straight-leg jeans from River Island, my red Adidas Samba's for a pop of colour, and layered with my long coat from Really Wild - I love using tailoring to elevate a casual look.</p><h2 data-gid=eT8Xl1iTRk dir=ltr><strong data-gid=e_D6-x1IPsO>The Feather Jacket</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/72fd602b838b-image00024.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/40a6b80dd128-image00026.jpg><p id=eTUJ7lbZms-A data-wc=70>Admittedly, I don't wear much colour, but <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored nofollow">this jacket</a></span> caught my eye online, and it looks even better in person.

I paired it with a plain cropped long-sleeved top from Zara and a vintage Topshop jacket that my auntie bought from Topshop over 20 years ago. Because of the silhouette, I'd suggest a short jacket like this to make it more flattering. Why not jazz it up with a <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored nofollow">feather clutch</a></span> or other statement bag to break up the black.</p><h2 data-gid=e0q0B7V6lu dir=ltr><strong data-gid=esmfFOQhYd6>The Feather Mini&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/9ccf3aafc964-image00225.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/4ec4c418fd03-image00226.jpg><p id=e1BdWk-3mjMh data-wc=91>I was feeling feathers for my birthday in October and rented this beautiful stone-ish <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>16Arlington dress from Swished</a> - a new rental platform with a focus on partywear. The delicate colourway of this dress was different to any other feather dresses I'd seen before and I loved it. I paired it with black knee-high boots that I bought from Vinted to 'dress it down' a little. If you're looking for something designer for a special occasion - go for a rental. This dress costs just £120 to rent for four days,.</p><h2 data-gid=e0JwEESrFV dir=ltr><strong data-gid=eocIB2I4KX>The Feather Dress</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/c1c2d21dc8a0-image00228.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/417ea9dc067a-image00227.jpg><p id=ei4c9EgRCEJl data-wc=117>The definition of a dramatic outfit. I attended an event at the Tower of London recently, which called for a special outfit, and what's more special than sequins and feathers combined? so I rented this stunning <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored nofollow">F.ILLK dress from MyWardrobe HQ</a></span> (for those London-based, they have a section in Harrods where they stock most pieces, which is great for any last-minute outfit drama). When I tried the dress I realised it was likely way too OTT, therefore toned it down with an oversized black blazer fastened with a belt. Not only is renting a sustainable option, but it's also great for trying before you buy. This dress costs £14 per day to rent and is £720 RRP.&nbsp;</p><p id=eYk3K-d9mFzb style=font-size:12px data-wc=42><a class=hm-link href=#>FAQ page</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue9aiqqFlnJ7AtXuUaW9ucGJks6K%2Fx6Kmp2WVmba1u9FmqZ6umZrEbrLEmquhnaJivLbAxaKrrGWglr%2B1xYysnJqrn6N8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
