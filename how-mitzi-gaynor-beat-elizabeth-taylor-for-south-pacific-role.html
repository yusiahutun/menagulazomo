To play Navy Ensign Nellie Forbush in the film, Mitzi, then 25, beat out several better-known actresses, including Elizabeth Taylor, Doris Day and Mary Martin, who had originated the role on Broadway."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I would tease him in my best Italian and say, ‘Rossano, you are the most gorgeous, the most talented, the most handsome man in all of the movies,’ and he’d answer, ‘Mitzi Gaynor…I know.’ I mean how could you not love that?”</p><p>A critical and popular favorite, South Pacific would become the fifth highest-grossing film of 1958. Mitzi, who is one of the few actors in the film who do their own singing, would star in other films but find career longevity in nightclubs, TV specials and as a recording star. “I wouldn’t have the opportunity,” she says, “if I hadn’t made South Pacific.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46hprBlnZ7Bu7WMoJiypp%2BneqOxwK1knqSZr66jsdOhZK2ZqaG8s3nFqKlmq5%2Bqwal5z5qaop6ZmHqzu8ueZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
