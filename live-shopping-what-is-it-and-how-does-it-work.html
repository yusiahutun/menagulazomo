It has no opening and closing times, no waiting lines or the pressure of those waiting for you to finish. You can look calmly, compare, change your mind a hundred times, put in and remove from the cart and browse again, add and change quantities without anyone seeing you.

Of course not, on the contrary, this has not been the case for a while in China. Live shopping in China was born in 2016 and has evolved through the interaction and participation of millions of users. Basically, we are talking about a live broadcast with functions that allow shopping and interactive chat ‚Äì one of the many sales methods that have become even more popular during the pandemic. Like many solutions born in a time of crisis, it seems to be here to stay and could become the new dimension of e-commerce.</p><h2>A less static e-commerce</h2><p>Today in China,&nbsp;buying online has become pure entertainment. E-commerce as we know it with product pages and photo galleries is already considered a static model in the country as it does not offer any experience accompanying sales.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>RN I‚Äôm watching a ‚Äúlive streaming commerce‚Äù on Taobao with my mom, with over 18 MILLIONS others watching and shopping together</p><p>This ‚Äúonline night market‚Äù phenomena is an amazing by-product of COVID 19 in China</p><p>I will try to explain the origin and mechanism in this thread <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/cxuN5WjAzC</a></p><p>‚Äî Dovey ‚ÄúRug The Fiat‚Äù Wanü™êü¶ñ (@DoveyWan) <a href=#>May 14, 2020</a></p><p>In 2020, live shopping sales generated ‚Ç¨115 billion in turnover in China and now account for more than 10% of the volume of all e-commerce transactions in this market.</p><p>In the Live section of&nbsp;Taobao, the most popular e-commerce platform in China with 800 million active users every month, you can find everything from the sale of animals and puppies to the farmer who sells you the orange by picking it from the tree or to the fisherman who shows you how he catches fish in real time.&nbsp;But the categories for which live shopping works best are food & beverage, cosmetics, jewelry, clothing and accessories ‚Äì including luxury.&nbsp;It is no coincidence these are the sectors in which consultancy or chat with the salesperson can make a significant difference.</p><h2>Live shopping examples to inspire your own</h2><h3>Walmart</h3><p>In December 2020, when consumers were hesitant to go to stores, the brand tested Live shopping on TikTok. Fashion items sold at Walmart were featured in content from ten TikTok creators, led by mega influencer Michael Le, whose dances on TikTok have earned him more than 43 million fans.</p><p>After the success of this first manoeuvre, Walmart continued to experiment with live shopping on other platforms. Last year, the company became the first retailer to test Twitter‚Äôs Live shopping feature as well.</p><p>Moving further into live shopping, the American retail giant announced in February that it has expanded its partnership with the live-shopping platform Talkshoplive and that regularly scheduled content will be available on its live shopping site: Walmart Live.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Join Amber of <a href=#>@damasklove</a> as she showcases all of her favorite, must-have spring crafting ideas (presented by <a href=#>@Walmart</a>)!

Nearly 6 million people watched the event live and Maybelline broke its sales record on Taobao.</p><p>Live shopping has met the ever-increasing need to shop in peace and enjoy the moment ‚Äì without having to carefully go through product descriptions and static photos for hours, especially in times of coronavirus. But even without the restrictions of the pandemic, the numbers show that live shopping continues to lead to far more sales than traditional e-commerce.</p><p>With the increasing number of e-commerce software, live shopping is expected to become increasingly relevant for almost any brand or retailer. In most cases, additional features are easy to integrate if you already have social media pages and an online store. And if you‚Äôre starting e-commerce from scratch, it‚Äôs good to start thinking about live shopping as part of your e-commerce strategy right away.</p><p><strong>Will you follow these examples to sell big in 2022 and beyond?
