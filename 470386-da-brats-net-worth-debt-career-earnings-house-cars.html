She struck her in the face with a rum bottle, forcing the waitress to go to an area hospital. As a result, the police arrested and jailed Da Brat.</p><p class=align-left>When she went to court, she pleaded guilty to aggravated assault, and the judge gave her a three-year<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> prison sentence</a>, seven years of probation, and 200 hours of community service. On 28 February 2011, the authorities released Da Brat from prison. Three years later, the victim she had assaulted in 2007 had started a civil trial.</p><p class=align-left>The trial began on 24 February 2014 and ended on 28 February 2014. A jury awarded the victim $6.4 million for her injuries and past and future loss of earnings. But that was just the beginning. In August 2018, Da filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Since she owed many people a lot of money, filing for bankruptcy meant that her debtors and creditors would have to reorganise their payment plans.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a2ed04b6e5597520.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Rich Dollaz's wife now?

One of her liabilities was a $6.4 million judgement she owed to the victim she assaulted in 2007. Furthermore, the rapper owned the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) several thousands of dollars, Sony Music $1.255 million, and Ally Bank $12,000.</p><p class=align-left>After filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the woman (Shayla Stevens ) she assaulted in 2007<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> filed another case</a> in court demanding that the rapper’s debt remain intact instead of wiping them clean. Da Brat had not made any payment since the case ended in February 2014. As a result, the money had increased to $8 million when filing for bankruptcy in 2018.</p><p class=align-left>Besides, the assault victim had tried different methods to get her money, including attempting to find Da Brat’s <a href=#>sources of income </a>to seize. For example, in 2018, she starred in a stage adaptation of the 1996 hood classic, <i>Set It Off.</i> Then, Shayla fired off a subpoena to Ticketmaster, the company that sold tickets to the play, demanding they give her all contracts with Da Brat and how much she would make.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d66ad01aeccf85d2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>2Baba's bio: wife, children, net worth, house, and cars</span></p></a><h3>How much does Da Brat make a year?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e0f10de9e16fcb94.png><p class=align-left>When she filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in 2018, Da Brat reported an income of $75,000 for the half-year and an average monthly income of $9,300.
