At a cocktail party in Episode 6 of Love Is Blind Season 6, Laura, a 34-year-old account director, joked to her fiance, Jeramey, a 32-year-old intralogistics expert, that he should “bean dip” AD, a 33-year-old real estate broker. Jeramey tells the group about the joke that Laura made, which weirds out both AD and Clay, a 32-year-old enterprise sales/entrepreneur and AD’s fiance.</p><p>AD explains to Laura that her comment didn’t come across as a joke, but Laura is more focused on getting mad at Jeramey for embarrassing her and telling the group about her “bean dip” remark. Laura’s scolding upsets Jeramey who tells her that he wants to go home—and not back to their hotel on vacation but to Charlotte, North Carolina, where they both live.</p><p>So what does bean dip mean on Love Is Blind Season 6? According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bean%20dip">Urban Dictionary</a>, a bean dip is described as when someone “raises the underboob of a man or woman with your index finger and second finger.” Another definition defines bean dip as “to flick a woman’s (or man’s) breast with the index finger.” A third definition described “bean dip” as a “funny word known as to scooping one or another’s boob.” Given the sexual definition of “bean dip” and that Laura was essentially joking for her fiance to touch another woman’s breasts, it’s understandable why AD and Clay didn’t think her comment was funny.</p><p>“AD had the WORST choices, then these women insecure around her because she has a good body, because why would you tell your man to “bean dip”another woman… #LoveIsBlindS6,” tweeted one user.</p><p>Another user tweeted, “Not Laura trying to invalidate Clay’s feelings about the bean dip joke. Why did you even tell Jeramey about that in the first place? Shout out to AD for checking her though. #LoveIsBlindS6 #LoveIsBlind #LoveIsBlind6.”</p><p>One more user wrote, “It’s very distasteful how they are sexualizing AD. From Jimmy over stepping and flirting with her to the stupid bean dip ‘joke’ #LoveIsBlindS6.”</p><p>Clay also reacted to the bean dip scene on Love Is Blind in an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://people.com/love-is-blind-clay-gravesande-ad-smith-react-jeramey-lutinski-bean-dip-joke-exclusive-8582070>People</a> in February 2024. “I think I said my reaction … when he said it initially, I was just like, ‘Bro, what are you talking about?'” Clay said. “But me and Jeramey have had weird banter where we kind of talked about that type of stuff. So it didn’t really throw me off. I was just surprised that Jeremy said that right there at that time period, but I wasn’t surprised that he said it.” He continued, “[There’s] no bad blood. I didn’t even think about it the next day.”</p><p>AD also confirmed to people that she and Laura were fine after the bean dip Love Is Blind drama. “I don’t really relish on that moment too much because it didn’t really affect me,” AD said. “And I’m kind of shocked that it affected them so much. So, I don’t really think about that often. … It was a girl’s thing that translated and went left, I guess.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfl7KiuoydoKllnKTDpnnIrGSbpJmjsW65xJqloqaXZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
