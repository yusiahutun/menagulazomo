The disease is caused by a tumour in the pituitary gland, a small, pea-sized gland at the base of the brain and in line with the top of the nose.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/02/b39e6ec5-f947-48db-b658-bd321cbec4ef_3eec3da0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a 1912 paper, The Pituitary Body and its Disorders, Cushing described Minnie G’s clinical condition as a “syndrome of painful obesity, hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth), and amenorrhoea (cessation of menstruation), with overdevelopment of secondary sexual characteristics accompanying a low grade of hydrocephalus (build-up of fluid in the brain) and increased cerebral tension”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He questioned whether this was the consequence of a tumour in the “pituitary, adrenal, pineal [glands] or ovary”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Two illness types, multiple causes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/03/95743f36-b56f-4397-a496-e3016af7133c_acae8d0e.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wu says there are several causes of Cushing’s syndrome. The most common is a prolonged exposure to steroids, usually prescribed. The patient will have taken oral steroids, injected them or applied them as a cream or lotion.</p>Schumer has been open about her long and hard battle with <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">endometriosis</span></a>, a painful disease that affects the uterus and is sometimes treated with high-dose steroid injections. She has been quoted as attributing her diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome to this.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Steroids are commonly used to treat asthma, skin allergies, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune conditions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/02/9c739da3-ee07-4f04-ad86-e73f870d7124_655f4f1f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In some patients, tumours in the pituitary gland may be triggering production of too much adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce excessive cortisol. This is the cause of Cushing’s disease, which is different from the syndrome that Schumer has.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Over time and if left untreated, the complications of either Cushing’s syndrome or disease can significantly affect quality of life and potentially be life-threatening, warns Wu.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Treatment for Cushing’s illnesses</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Both the syndrome and the disease are treatable. If the syndrome was caused by taking or applying steroids, they should be stopped if the patient’s condition allows. The disease may be cured by surgical removal of the pituitary tumour, although it may grow back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/02/71bc107b-9efd-495d-958e-403e0758e248_58dda525.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Minnie G’s case, Cushing performed a subtemporal decompression – removing a small piece of skull bone to release pressure in the brain.</p>This succeeded in alleviating her headaches, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">lowered her blood pressure</span></a>, and helped her lose weight. She lived until 1958, some 26 years after her last appointment with Cushing.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Schumer spent hours in MRI machines having scans, and underwent dozens of blood tests, as doctors tried to establish what her problem was and its cause.
