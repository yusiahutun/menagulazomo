"Lady Amelia looked lovely! But being a Spencer I was expecting something more traditional. What she got was an avant-garde Versace. Lady Kitty looked far more formal and royal. A ton of lace from Dolce & Gabbana. It’s just a shame that neither of the Spencer girls went with British designers," he said.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eG7Hnc8nLfb data-wc=66>Speaking about how Diana's dress changed bridal fashion in general, David is very modest. "Every<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;royal bride</a>'s wedding gown has an influence in the bridal market. Since then, we have lived through various silhouettes, namely fishtail, A-line, slim fitted and now in 2024 it has come full circle. At bridal exhibitions around the world, crinolines are now back in fashion. Everything in fashion goes full circle!"</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Meghan Markle's off-the-shoulder bridal dress was one of her best red carpet moments" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/9ad89c3f6fd7-meghan-white-hat.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Meghan Markle's off-the-shoulder bridal dress was one of her best red carpet moments" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Meghan Markle's off-the-shoulder bridal dress was one of her best red carpet moments</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Rebellious Princess Diana's second wedding dress took more risks than daughters-in-law" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/65107692259a-princess-diana-wedding-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Rebellious Princess Diana's second wedding dress took more risks than daughters-in-law" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Rebellious Princess Diana's second wedding dress took more risks than daughters-in-law</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Princess Diana looked just like a modern bride in stunning mini dress" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/361d8eeb5482-gettyimages-52103622.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Princess Diana looked just like a modern bride in stunning mini dress" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Princess Diana looked just like a modern bride in stunning mini dress</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eL2hXGhSVBN data-wc=60><a class=hm-link href=#>The Duke of Westminster</a> is due to be married in June. We are all excited to see what bride <a class=hm-link href=#>Olivia Henson</a> will wear, and David too. "Let’s wait and see. Keep the suspense and excitement for the big day. She will wear something she looks fabulous in and hopefully feels comfortable in. This goes for every bride the world over."</p><p id=edro4Yumkoj data-wc=29>David is so passionate about his gorgeous new collection with Bonmarché . "It’s modern, well manufactured and extremely well priced.

"The <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">long line ivory tweed jacket with gold thread</a></span>. It’s perfect for a smart meeting, wonderful for the mother of the bride.

"It’s very flattering when a celebrity selects and wears one of my designs. But this collection is available to all women because of the price points. Equally as flattering is when I meet ladies on the high street wearing my designs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c52e01e190ee-gettyimages-73399907.jpg><p id=e1S8OLRCy4 data-wc=54>We loved seeing <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Diana's dress in The Crown</a>; it was seen from the back during the programme.
