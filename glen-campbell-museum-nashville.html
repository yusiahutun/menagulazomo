The sadness lingers.”</p><p>The new 4,000-square-foot museum will be located on the corner of Broadway and 2nd Avenue, and it will transform into a live music venue during the evenings. Inside the museum, guests will find personal artifacts from the Campbell family including instruments, never-before-seen photos, stage clothes and more.</p><p>“When I touch his clothes and when I look at the pictures of us together, it’s heart-wrenching for me, because I miss him every single day,” Kim noted. “I feel like it’s a way to honor him, and I want to do everything I can to preserve his legacy and to share it with future generations.”</p><p>Campbell was a world-renowned artist, songwriter, guitarist, actor and television personality. Campbell hosted The Glen Campbell Good Time Hour variety show from 1969-1972 and acted in the 1969 film True Grit alongside John Wayne.</p><p><a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> reported that once the museum is completed early next year, there will be a grand gala opening with live performances celebrating the creation from members of the Campbell family and friends of Glenn.</p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Next: Glen Campbell's Wife Recalls His Final Moments</a><p><strong>True Grit: Glen Campbell's Life in Pictures</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmoKSVo3qkrcypmZ6knGK6tr%2FErqRmppGotbe1y6WcaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
