Sure, you might recall how they sparred during the primary debates, but ultimately, as Biden noted, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>no grudges</a> were held — and that's a big deal for someone who was born with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>stellium</a> (aka three or more planets in one sign) in fixed water sign Scorpio.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Biden and Harris led with a simpatico vibe all the way through to the pivotal November election, eventually clinching victory in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on November 7... and then <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>officially cementing his victory on December 14</a> winning 306 total electoral votes to Trump's 232.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But what do the planets have to say about their professional compatibility as we approach Inauguration Day? Are they destined to be a formidable, irresistibly likable pair like Biden was with Obama? Thankfully, synastry — an astrological compatibility study between two people in any kind of relationship, including a political partnership — can offer insight on their strengths and weaknesses as a team.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here, what Biden (sun in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Scorpio</a>, born on November 20, 1942 at 8:30 a.m. in Scranton, Pennsylvania) and Harris' (sun in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Libra</a>, born on October 20, 1964 at 9:28 p.m. in Oakland, California) astrological charts say about their potential to be a real power duo in the White House.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cozy-moon-signs-mean-similar-emotional-compasses></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cozy Moon Signs Mean Similar Emotional Compasses</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You might have heard that your moon sign represents your emotional core. Both Harris and Biden were born on full moons, giving them idealistic, relationship-oriented, passionate perspectives on life. Plus, the moon was almost in the exact same spot when the candidates were born, meaning they're wired similarly, emotionally speaking. (Harris was born with her moon at 27º Aries, while Biden was born with his at 0º Taurus, and there are 30 degrees between signs.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Clearly, both are driven to win (very much an Aries trait) and to honor and cherish restorative home life (a Taurean characteristic), among other shared worldviews. It's no wonder they have spoken of seeing eye-to-eye on the importance of family and bringing pragmatic, effective leadership to the White House.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the same time, Harris' Taurus Jupiter is conjunct (meaning, in the same sign) Biden's natal moon, which leads to shared optimism and drive to take on a big picture challenge as a team.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-their-mercury-conjunction-makes-them-super-communicative></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Their Mercury Conjunction Makes Them Super Communicative</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While it's not exactly the opposite of a Mercury retrograde, being born with Mercury, the planet of communication, in the same sign as a partner — or, in this case, running mate — could make it much easier to connect mentally. Both Harris and Biden were born with the messenger planet in intense, commanding, family-revering, private water sign Scorpio. This means they're both intellectually fired up to dive into deep, perhaps even taboo topics that others might not want to touch with a 10-foot pole. They're also both invested in getting to the root of any issue before making a decision.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This likemindedness could explain why Biden felt it was natural to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>ask Harris "to be the last one in the room,"</a> in order to tell him the truth and challenge him with hard questions. They may think and express themselves similarly, but neither will shy away from being brutally honest when necessary.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-gemini-sagittarius-axis-brings-them-in-sync-on-knowledge></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Gemini-Sagittarius Axis Brings Them in Sync on Knowledge</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The sign that was ascending on the eastern horizon at the time of your birth is considered your rising or ascendant. Harris is a Gemini rising, while Biden is a Sagittarius rising. Harris' communicative air sign is opposite Biden's knowledge-seeking fire sign, but in this case, that opposition works in their favor. It means they activate one another's seventh house of partnership, which involves not just romantic relationships but business and political pairings.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They also connect on their appetite for knowledge, sharing ideas, and being lifelong learners. Both Gemini and Sag are hungry for knowledge and sharing ideas. Geminis bring a lighthearted, open-minded approach to communication, while Sag pulls no punches, generally speaking in a passionate, unfiltered way (sounds like Uncle Joe, no?). Together, they're research-savvy, cerebral, and enthusiastic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another way the two connect on this axis: Biden's Saturn (the taskmaster planet) and Uranus (the revolution planet) are conjunct Harris' rising in Gemini. Saturn-rising conjunctions denote a mentor-mentee relationship, which sounds fairly fitting for an older statesman POTUS and rising star Vice President. Uranus-rising conjunctions set the stage for bolstered individuality, open-mindedness, and powerful change.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-this-means-for-the-biden-harris-ticket></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What This Means for the Biden-Harris Ticket</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Biden and Harris' charts illustrate that the President and Vice President-elect are not only like-minded on policy and their personal lives, but they balance one another's communication styles — Harris' being a bit more free-flowing and diplomatic, while Biden has a tendency to be passionate and unfiltered. They are also astrologically wired to be in sync in terms of what drives them emotionally. In other words, they're a solid power duo, capable of both seeing eye-to-eye and challenging one another.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8qapJqkkWK1or7Roqpmop%2BaeqO1w56lZpmjqb%2BwuM6goJyZnGKwsLnPmquimpmhtrXF</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
