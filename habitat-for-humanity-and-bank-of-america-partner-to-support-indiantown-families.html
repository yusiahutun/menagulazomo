The community features a 22,000-square-foot Boys & Girls Club in the center and is currently home to 34 Habitat partner families. The final six homes in Carter Park are expected to be completed in the summer of 2021.</span></p><p><span>“Having seen Carter Park go from six acres of thick woods to this beautiful neighborhood that stands there today is amazing,” said Graff. “If you put a guarded gate at the entrance to Carter Park, you would think it’s just like any another gated community around the county.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tMDUmqmtpZGcrru1zZ5lnKedZMGptc2gqmasn2KxsHvAq6auppRiwbDDzWaroaGenMBuwM5mm6hnmJavqsDArWSfp6Jitba5wKegrbFdlrulecGapaRln5t6ornEq6CcmV2lrrPAzZ6pZqyfYsC2vM%2Boqa1lmaOxqq3Nraawpl2brq61y6KcrGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
