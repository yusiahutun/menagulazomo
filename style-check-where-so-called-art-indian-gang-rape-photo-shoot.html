Now, there are fewer issues more contentious, sensitive or tragic as what happened to Jyoti Singh after she was gang-raped aboard a public bus in Delhi on her way home from the cinema."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She died later in a Singapore hospital despite efforts to save her.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The incident sparked nationwide protests, legislative reform in 2013 and debate on all strata of Indian society. So it is no surprise that once Shetye’s shoot went viral, outrage has poured from social media in India and around the world.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Others, however, show a female model in an obvious state of distress being grabbed at by several of the male models.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shetye, however, has claimed his shoot had nothing to do with the Delhi incident, and was conceived before it happened.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yet, even if this is true, you wonder how he could have failed to see the implications of publishing the shoot while the case is still at the forefront of national and international consciousness.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is in no way meant to glamorise the act, which was very bad,” Shetye told BuzzFeed. “It’s just a way of throwing light on it.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This follows Franca Sozzani’s tasteless “domestic abuse” fashion shoot in Vogue Italia which sparked similar controversy and disgust, yet she defended the shoot as a way of bringing attention to the issue.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shetye, remarkably, claimed the same thing in a correspondence with The Independent, saying that the shoot was inspired by the restrictions and prejudice he saw around him.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s unfortunate that I am compelled to justify my artistic expression around a social issue,” he told The Independent, then went on to say he was glad he had sparked debate on the issue.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If the cost to set the ball-rolling here is that I have [to] be the bad guy, then [so be it].”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I’m really not sure if Shetye is suffering from stupidity or ignorance to think that his “contribution” to the issue of rape or general sexism and violence against women in India is constructive in anyone’s world.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Idiotic at best, disgusting and disrespectful at worst, seems to be the sentiment online.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What good this shoot does exactly, people are all wondering. These ill-conceived, heavy-handed attempts within fashion to bring light to social issues are often not malicious in intent, but increasingly exasperating to onlookers worldwide, even within the industry.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6zwNJmmq6kpKq%2FpnvAq6uim5yafHKBlXFraWlfqMG6uMRmmqGdk6B6uLTEq5xmq59isKK4y56bZpmiqXqqusOimKdll5a7qHnRmqeeZaCdvLW7jKyfqKek</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
