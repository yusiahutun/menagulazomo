The Hollywood star passed away on the eve of the Oscars at age 94 so it’s possible that the Academy didn’t have enough time to include him in the segment.</span></p><p>Before Carol’s death, she told Closer Weekly that she <a href=#>had no regrets about her prolific life and career</a>. “Even the poor choices contributed to lessons I needed to learn and God’s ultimate plan for my life,” she said. “I am convinced the most healing experience in the world is work, if you enjoy what you do.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/carol-channing1.jpg><p>Carol has had such a successful career in Hollywood that it was hard for her to choose a favorite role. “The next one is always my favorite,” she once explained. “You can’t pick one over another, because in order to do a good job, you have to be completely in love with that character. If you’re not, the audience knows. Love and laughter may be the most important ingredients to achieve longevity.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46cmKunnGKwqa3Np6Cnn12hsqfAjKisrWWfm3pzfJByZKirk5a%2FtHnIp2SmnZ2kv6qtzGaqnp%2Bdmru1ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
