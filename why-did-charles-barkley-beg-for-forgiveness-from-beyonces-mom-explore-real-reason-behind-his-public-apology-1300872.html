He said, "Miss Knowles, I don't want that smoke. I don't want the Beyhive and Jay after me." in a humorous tone.</p><p>Though it seemed like an apology, Barkley couldn't resist taking another jab at Galveston when asked if he changed his mind about the city.

However, the team struggled with consistency.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGiqqaeiqcBww8eyZJ2hlGKwqa3RpZysZZKWv6y4xLJkm52XYrOwvoyfpqufmauyr7HSrGSfqp%2BieqOx2KilnJ2jYrqwuYyer6mkn6eybr7EmqNmqpWWwLC6jJucoaGemXqptdJmp66anJ6wbq3PqKOon6lifnR8j3Fuaw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
