When we have positive social interactions, our bodies release endorphins that help make&nbsp;us&nbsp;feel good.</p><p>Social media platforms have become aware of how to manipulate this reward response to increase engagement and time spent on apps.</p><p>When you receive positive feedback on a post you made or picture you uploaded, it releases some of those endorphins. This is what keeps people on the platforms for hours. But it can also lead to increased feelings of anxiety, depression, and loneliness.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Casinos use the same types of tactics to get people to spend more time, and money, on their business.

This can be especially helpful for people who live in smaller towns&nbsp;and have a deep desire to broaden their&nbsp;horizons.</p><p>While you can't exactly remain anonymous on social media without creating a fake profile, you can create a whole new persona.&nbsp;This can help people who have a hard time socializing to break out of their shells.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Ways Instagram Is Trying to Protect Teenagers From Creeps</a></span></p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Where social media has gotten into trouble is when these personas get pulled to the dark side.</p><p>About <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 percent of teens</a> report being bullied on social media and even more claim they have been the recipient of offensive remarks. Being on the receiving end can lead to lower self-esteem and self-image.</p><p>It's also hard to express clear and concise communication when only using a keyboard. Language gets lost in translation without more communication clues to give context, like body language.</p><p>What could have been intended as an innocent remark could be taken personally. This could lead to an argument that could have been avoided if it had been made in person.</p><p>Communication on social media still has some maturing to do before it becomes a force for good.</p><h2 id=social-media-s-divisive-effect>Social Media's Divisive Effect</h2><p>At no other time in the history of the world has it been easier to connect with someone from around the world as it is today.

Groups that would threaten the wellbeing of&nbsp;others were allowed to assemble online.</p><p>The election of 2016 was controversial for the use of foreign interference through Facebook ads to swing the vote of the public.</p><p>The continued disparity between political opinions is a big reason why <a href=#>Americans feel social media is doing more harm than good</a>&nbsp;these days.</p><p>The power of social media to influence entire nations has come under the microscope with recent events and other forms of media, like movies. Documentaries like The Social Dilemma have shown exactly what kind of manipulation social media is capable of.</p><p>Our dependence on social media is causing large consequences to how we live our lives. Although, the same could potentially be said about any form of media.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The only difference is&nbsp;the scale that social media operates on and the instantaneous effect of that power.

Social media has, essentially, turned into a marketing platform.</p><p>Facebook, Instagram, and even LinkedIn have all drastically reduced the organic reach of posts with algorithmic timelines. This means fewer and fewer people get to see what you post unless you want to pay for advertising.</p><p>Only a handful of people, known as influencers, have a massive audience. And many of them have financial reasons for their posts.&nbsp;They sell products by making their social feeds filled with good experiences and amazing places.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>This leads to a majority of people on the platform trying to make their life seem it's just as good. This can lead to severe loneliness and&nbsp;pressure from always comparing your life to others without knowing the context behind the pictures.</p><h2 id=the-future-of-social-media-in-society>The Future of Social Media in Society</h2><p>Social media, in and of itself, is not bad or harmful to society. What makes it harmful is how we use it and how we feel about ourselves while using it.</p><p>Right now, that pendulum is swinging in the wrong direction, but all it takes is enough people choosing to use it for the right reasons.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGibqJ2jYsCwr8iao2allZm2onnDqGSmp6Kaeqmt0aZkraCRo3qou86dZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
