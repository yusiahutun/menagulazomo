The actor — who has kids William, 26, and Lillie, 24, with his first wife, <a href=#>Kirstie Alley</a> — wed his new bride at the Demetria Vineyards in Los Olivos, CA, before flying off to enjoy their honeymoon in Israel.

While the 66-year-old loves acting as well, and during a 2013&nbsp;sit-down with <a href=#>Smashing Interviews Magazine</a>, he gushed over his life-long passion for photography.</p><p>“I’m still acting, but I’m definitely focused on this,” he said of his photography career. “I get up in the morning and edit. I get up in the morning and make calls to line up shoots. This is really where my focus is, but I have not stopped acting. I love acting. But you’re a cog in the wheel. You’re just a part of the overall picture.”</p><p>“I do wonder if I should have been shooting all along instead of acting,” Parker added of his role of Frank Hardy on&nbsp;Hardy Boys&nbsp;back in the 70s. “You can’t go back, but I had come out of Princeton not quite ready to commit to architecture and was going to NYU business school when I got offered&nbsp;The Hardy Boys. I thought, ‘Oh, okay. I’ll go do this for a bit.’ That really sent me off on that path. I had already done three features and 120 commercials and had worked a lot, but that&nbsp;really&nbsp;kind of set me going forward more purposefully in acting.”</p><p>Between Parker’s acting and photography skills and Lisa’s cooking skills, they make the perfect power couple!
