A few factors appealed to them about this design. The company is based in Gardiner, Maine, and since Stephen’s mother grew up in Down East Maine, there was a sentimental aspect at play. There was also some practicality involved: The layout of a dual console was perfect for their grow</span>ing interest in partaking in some extended <span class=s2>cruises with their local boating club.</span></p><p class=p3>For short trips to the Keys or the Bahamas, the comfortable layout of the Southport 33 DC just made sense. This design offers more amenities for the leisurely pursuits the Tabors enjoy while boating, versatile enough to provide opportunities for fishing, cruising, and simple relaxation all at once.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2022/08/A-copilot-lounge-provides-seating-protected-from-the-hot-sun.-Photo-by-George-LaBonte-1024x774.jpg><p class=p3>This Southport 33 offers comfortable forward seating <span class=s2>in a wraparound setting that can be configured as a sun lounge or a dining venue. Amidships, she boasts a comfortable copilot lounge to port opposite the helm seating to starboard. The large hardtop provides welcome relief from the tropical sun. Within the air-conditioned portside console/cabin are a pair of 6-foot berths. To starboard below the helm is a dedicated head compartment with an electric freshwater toilet.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2022/08/A-wraparound-seating-area-can-operate-as-a-sun-lounge-or-a-dining-venue.-Photo-by-George-LaBonte-300x209.jpg><p class=p3>The cockpit aft is wide open for fishing or diving convenience and features an aft-facing seat along with foldaway L-shaped bench seating. Across the transom, there is a large, insulated fish box with optional chill plates and a 35-gallon live well. <span class=s2>A side-opening dive door to starboard offers easy access to the cockpit for divers as well as </span><span class=s3>for boarding dockside. The 33 DC also incorporates an integrated</span><span class=s2> swim platform to the transom on opposite corners of her twin<br>Yamaha 425-HP power plant.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>Upon returning home from the boat show, the Tabors took the leap and purchased their new vessel from Stuart-based </span><span class=s3>Sand N Sea Marine Group. Ultimately,</span> it was a combination of the seaworthiness and style, top quality hardware and finish work, classic Carolina-inspired lines and Down East craftsman<span class=s3>ship, and practical multipurpose</span> functionality of the layout that closed the deal for the Tabors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2022/08/Bow-of-the-Southport-33-DC.-Photo-by-George-LaBonte-1024x658.jpg><h2 class=p1>Power File</h2><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Length:</b></span> 32 feet, 6 inches</p><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Beam:</b></span> 10 feet, 8 inches</p><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Draft:</b></span> 21.5 inches</p><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Deadrise:</b></span> 22 degrees</p><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Weight:</b></span> 10,000 pounds</p><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Fuel:</b></span> 250 gallons</p><p class=p3><b>Max HP:</b><span class=s2> 850</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tMDUmqmtpZGcrru1zZ5lnKedZMC1wcCrq2akmZuycLvUrZuop6KofLTAxKlkmpqflr%2BledOhnGarn6rBqbzOq6tma2NisaR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
