Never a good thing when I have to practice saying my name and have to be told that I have too much emotion in my name," she told <a href=#><strong>THR</strong></a> of her decision to quit.</p><p>"I think I did seven takes on just my name because it was 'too emotional'. I go, 'Is the too much emotion in the 'Oprah' part or the 'Winfrey' part?"</p><p>She continued: "I had a deja vu moment because I've actually lived through this once before when I covered a story as a young reporter [where] the family had lost their home and my boss told me that I reported it with too much emotion. I had too much emotion in the story."</p><p>"I thought, 'OK, so you're not supposed to be involved in the story, I get that. You're a journalist.' But the same thing is true even with a read [at 60 Minutes]. They would say, 'All right, you need to flatten out your voice, there's too much emotion in your voice.'</p><p>"So I was working on pulling myself down and flattening out my personality — which, for me, is actually not such a good thing."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:7eb9acb6-e56b-5991-a1d2-92b226938bec data-container-ref=toofab:article:24f01b70-c329-5c9d-a818-a78b9ab1aead data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/be/5by4/2019/03/26/bef6dc4d5524547f9f5fe6d482c620ac_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Reese Witherspoon Nails Impression Of Gayle King for Oprah</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In the wide ranging interview, Oprah also discussed what she watches on TV (only "The Crown"), how she is giving up screen acting (but was recently very tempted to make a return to Broadway) and how she has yet to decide which presidential runner to endorse — but soon will.</p><p>She also revealed that it was Bill Cosby who first convinced her to buy her own plane.</p><p>"Nobody likes to mention this name now, but I had multiple conversations with Bill Cosby about getting a plane," she said. "I was trying to justify it, like, 'OK, if I put 10 people on the plane, that would've been how many airfares would I have to pay for?' And he said, 'You'll never be able to justify it because it's a true luxury. You can make a decision that you're going to take the leap and do it or not, but you'll never be able to justify the expense.'
