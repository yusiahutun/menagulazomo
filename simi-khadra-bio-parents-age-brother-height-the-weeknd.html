The pair were reportedly spotted together in Los Angeles enjoying dinner together and leaving the lavish Sunset Tower hotel together after a cozy dinner date. However, not everything the eye sees is true and they have a different story to share. According to a source who exclusively revealed to E! News, everything between the pair is purely platonic.</p><p>The news outlet reported, “The Weeknd and Simi are not dating. They’ve been friends for years.”</p><p>In September 2021, an insider had revealed to E! News that they have been enjoying each other’s company and that’s as far as it ever went. The source confirmed, “They are not dating. They have mutual interests and are enjoying putting their ideas together to see what they can come up with. They have been recently talking about partnering on a few humanitarian projects together. He loves talking about movies and the art form.”</p><p>Simi was also spotted at The Weeknd’s album release party for Dawn FM in Jan 2022. Delilah in West Hollywood hosted the event. Naturally, there were whispers about Khadra and the artist.</p><p>But, fans have been rooting for the two and couldn’t shake off the thoughts that they aren’t dating each other.</p><p>When The Weekend released his album in January, fans went online to discuss if one of his song’s lyrics contained a reference to Angelina Jole who divorced from Brad Pitt in 2016. Fans theorized that the song was about Angelina Jolie although he didn’t name her explicitly. All the references were made clear after he was spotted sharing a meal with Angelina.</p><p>“Call Out My Name” singer has previously dated Selena Gomez and Bella Hadid.</p><h3><strong>Simi Khadra Age</strong></h3><p>As of February 2022, Simi Khadra is 29 years old.</p><h3><strong>Simi Khadra Brother</strong></h3><p>Everyone knows by now that Simi Khadra has an identical twin sister named Haze Khadra (real name Haya Abu Khadra). But, she also has an older brother named <a href=#>Fai Khadra</a>. Fai is a social media influencer, a model, and a musician. He has a staggering 2.4 million followers on Instagram. He has collaborated with sunglass brand Oliver Peoples and launched <a href=#>exclusive sunglasses</a> with the influential mindset of Fai.</p><p>Fai once sparked a dating rumor after hanging out with Kendall Jenner. Kendall uploaded a photo of herself and Khadra dressed up for the wedding, both debunking and fueling the dating rumors with her caption: “We don’t date he’s just my date.”</p><p>As a creative director and artist, Fai has also interviewed <a href=#>Sotheby’s</a> about his love of contemporary art and being a minimalist art heart.</p><p>On 9 September 2020, the twin sisters wished happy birthday via IG post, “<span title=Edited>Happy birthday <a class=notranslate tabindex=0 href=#>@yourboyfai</a> !!!!!!!!! We love you so much. our triplet but the favorite child! And the best brother we could have ever asked for LOVEYOULOVEYOULOVEYOUUU”.</span></p><p>They also have a younger brother named <a href=#>Noor Khadra</a>, a polo player.

The girls have featured their father a few times on their social. His last appearance on their IG was in <a href=#>June 2019</a>.</p><p>The twin DJs credit their mother for most informing their style. “She taught us about what’s important: quality, material, cuts. She taught us what looks right,” says Simi revealed to Interview Magazine.</p><p>In April 2020, she celebrated their mom’s birthday with an IG post, “Happy birthday mom. The quintessence of grace and composure, even after raising a tornado of 5 kids. We love you and aspire to be more like you every day”.</p><h3><strong>Simi Khadra Height</strong></h3><p>According to IMG Models, Simi Khadra stands tall at 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 meters).</p><h3><strong>Simi Khadra Before Surgery</strong></h3><p>There is much dramatic difference in the before and after pictures which confirms that Simi Khadra and her twin sister performed multiple surgeries. Dr. Gary Motykie is a board-certified plastic surgeon who analyzed their surgeries which brought huge changes in appearance on them. The first surgery which they had performed is the nose which the doctor stated was the cornerstone of the surgery.</p><p>He alleged that the rhinoplasty was performed on both of them. Another apparent change was around the face which appeared more contoured but since their before and after photos don’t have much age difference and there was no significant loss of weight so he confirmed they had performed surgeries on their cheeks.</p><p>Furthermore, the surgeon also addressed the re-shaping of the brows and maybe some micro-blading.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Simi Khadra Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Simi Khadra sits on a total net worth of under $1 million as of this writing.</p><p>Simi is one-half of the twin DJ duo SIMI and HAZE along with her sister Haze. The sisters also launched various beauty products under the name SIMIHAZE BEAUTY. Besides music and makeup, they are also very big in the modeling industry.</p><p>They started attending fashion weeks young – like, 14 young – as buyers for their mother’s Riyadh-based boutique, before moving to the States to study. She and her sister went from friends asking them to DJ house parties to taking shoot requests from&nbsp;Vogue Italia&nbsp;between classes.</p><p>“Menswear has become more and more exciting for us. We grew up doing women’s collections and then we saw menswear become a little more accessible, through people like&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Virgil [Abloh]</a>, Matt Williams, and Kanye,” Simi told GQ. “These are the people who were giving the keys to the next generation – where you can be a part of the luxury space, even though you didn’t come from that place at all.”</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Simi Khadra Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Simi Kahdra celebrated her birthday on 31 March.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Simi Khadra Still Friends With Bella Hadid?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Yes, Simi Khadra is still friends with Bella Hadid.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Simi Khadra On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Simi’s IG account is (@simihaze) which currently has 1.4 million followers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmrKGdnnqstMCdqZplkp68brzAq5ynrKNirqixjJupqKyYmr9utMSinqGsXam1pnnWnpykppRk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
