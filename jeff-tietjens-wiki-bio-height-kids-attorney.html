The successful attorney from San Francisco California received his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in law and administration from Dartmouth College in the late 1990s. He is currently a lawyer with his own law firms in New York and San Francisco.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Jeff-Tietjens-Aisha-Tyler-640x452.jpg><p>On his own, he is quite successful and his bank balances and net worth are proof of this fact. Tietjens’ net worth is estimated at around $5.0 million and he has a fat paycheck to back it up. In addition, the successful Los Angeles lawyer lived in a house estimated at $2.0 million with 2507 square feet three bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who Is Jamie Afifi? Bio, Wife, Children, Family, Other Facts</a></strong></p><p>Jeff Tietjens Wiki would be even more incomplete if we didn’t mention the true news about him these days concerning his divorce from his wife Aisha Tyler of about 23 years. The two were lovers at college school who married in 1992. They met while attending Dartmouth College New Hampshire and they must have really got along well when they decided to take the courageous step of holy marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Jeff-Tietjens-Wiki.jpg><p>The hammer of separation came on their unification in 2015 and since then it has been quite a roller coaster ride in a divorce case. Until April 2016 Tietjens filed for divorce from Tyler citing irreconcilable differences. It really surprised everyone when you consider that they have been together for quite some time. Most Hollywood marriages don’t last even a quarter of the time they had so it was pretty sad that they had to end.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Jeff-Tietjens-Aisha-Tyler-1.jpg><p>As people tried to figure out exactly what caused the separation they came to a whole series of reasons. First they pointed out the fact that Aisha couldn’t have children but this speculation went down as the rumor that it was. That leaves practically everything else nobody really knows why Jeff filed for divorce but it is obvious that Aisha is not very happy with the decision.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Jeff-Tietjens-Wiki-Bio-Height-Kids-Attorney.jpg><p>Although alimony was not part of the divorce agreement the court ordered Aisha in recent events to pay the sum of 2.0 million dollars in marriage to her ex-husband. So she will be obliged to pay $31250 per month over the next four years plus an additional $500000 and he will also receive the couple’s Lexus in 2012 while she can keep her Tesla in 2013.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Josina Anderson’s Wiki, Bio, Married, Husband, Bald, Net Worth</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Jeff Tietjens Height/Kids</strong></h2><p>Jeff has only recently been subject to such public scrutiny so it is not surprising that his height and other body measurements are not listed. As already mentioned he had no children with his ex-wife Aisha Tyler as she could not conceive. So it is safe to say that the lawyer has no children at this moment.
