There are 30 sex toys currently in my pleasure box. I’ve tested all of them—some in solo play, some in partnered sex, and some in both. All of that said, nothing compares to the Womanizer Starlet 3 ($69)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It comes with a magnetic USB charging cable, a user manual, safety instructions, and Womanizer’s patented Pleasure Air Technology. In case you’re unfamiliar, this technology uses gentle, no-contact air pressure to simulate suction—and my goodness does it feel good.<br><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=pros>Pros</h2></p><ul class=is-style-pros><li>Compact</li><li>Waterproof</li><li>Easy to clean</li><li>Discreet</li><li>Rechargeable</li><li>Intuitive interface</li></ul><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=cons>Cons</h2></p><ul class=is-style-cons><li>Charger can be tricky to figure out</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=first-impressions>First Impressions</h2><p>I got the Womanizer Starlet 3 as a gift from the brand back in 2021. When I first saw it, I thought the silicone tip was way too deep to provide pleasurable clitoral stimulation. I’m euphoric to report that I was wrong. It’s about one centimeter deep, which cocoons your clit regardless of how large or small it is.</p><p>I was also impressed by how compact the toy is. It fit perfectly in the palm of my hand, which friends have always described as “tiny.” You can easily take this with you on a road trip or a plane and it’ll go undetected.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/starlet-3.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-vibes-are-right>The Vibes Are Right</h2><p>I first encountered the Starlet 3 during an experiment I conducted, during which I masturbated nightly before bed for a week. The week came and went—as did I—and the Starlet 3 cemented itself as my new favorite vibe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/starlet-3-2.jpg><p>Since then, and I am not even slightly exaggerating, I’ve used this toy at least 100 times. Whether I’m looking for a quick orgasm, treating myself to an elongated self-pleasure session, or hoping to spice up partnered play, best believe I’m reaching for the Starlet 3.</p><p>For solo play, I usually apply a few drops of water-based lube directly into the clitoral suction crevice. Then, I’ll expose my clitoris and place the suction portion of the toy directly on my clitoris. If my mission is to bang out the big O in record time, I’ll set the vibe to its maximum intensity, enjoy the ever-elusive ecstasy, and be on my merry way.</p><p>During my longer masturbation sessions, I’ll sometimes start by using the Starlet 3 on each of my nipples (on its lowest setting) before working my way down. When I get to my clit, I’ll keep the toy on a low setting to build pleasure. Once I’m warmed up, I’ll gradually increase the intensity—which, in turn, escalates my arousal. When I’m nearing the finish, I’ll go up to the maximum setting to help propel me over the line.</p><p>Now, on to partnered play. At first, I was concerned that my partner and I might not find this toy enjoyable during sex. Not because I don’t like clitoral stimulation and penetration simultaneously, but because of the hard plastic on the exterior of the toy. The Starlet 3 proved me wrong yet again.</p><p>I’ve used the Starlet 3 during two-person sex about a dozen times in different positions, and no one has complained about any pain or discomfort. That said, I have noticed that some positions are better than others for incorporating this vibe. Those include cowgirl, reverse cowgirl, and doggy style—basically anything that doesn’t place weight directly on the vibrator, like missionary.</p><p>And, not for nothing, but I’ve found that this toy is perfect for mutual masturbation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-to-know-if-this-is-the-right-toy-for-you>How To Know If This Is the Right Toy for You&nbsp;</h2><p>In short, you’ll love the Womanizer Starlet 3 if you’re a fan of clitoral stimulation and intense clitoral orgasms. On the other hand, if you’re someone who requires penetration, you likely won’t like this vibe. The Starlet 3 doesn’t have any penetrative component—not an integrated shaft or attachment—so I’d suggest looking elsewhere.</p><p>If that sounds like you, I’d recommend the <a data-pmc-sp-product=9807ddf3e5dd1c1b8dd456072e9342a5 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Womanizer Duo 2","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Womanizer Duo 2 Clitoral Sucking Rabbit Vibrator - Clit G-spot Vibrating Sex Toy - 14 Intensity Levels & 10 Vibration Modes - Waterproof G spot Vibrating Toy - Rechargeable Dual Stimulator - Lilac","price":"219.00","id":"B0BMSGT73G","category":"Amazon.com Stores"},"id":1718232,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Womanizer Duo 2</a> ($219). This toy has a clitoral suction component and a curved shaft that’s designed to stimulate your G-spot.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</h2><p>When my editor asked me to pen a sex toy review, I knew I had to cover the Womanizer Starlet 3. It’s served up many orgasms for me and has gotten me out of some serious slumps. In fact, a friend of mine with whom I often share TMI, has lovingly dubbed this vibe my “old reliable.” And I don’t see that changing any time soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8uorZ5lo5rFcH2Wam9ra2JkxLC5wKegs52iYsC1rdGlnK1lY2K%2FpsLInq5o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
