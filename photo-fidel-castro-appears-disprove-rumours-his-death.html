The fact that Castro published a congratulatory note to medical students in a government newspaper on Thursday did little to dampen down the rumours.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Castro photo issued to disprove death rumours</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXyivtOimqWdX2Z9d4OTaWloqJikwbB5xaKbnqRdmK60wNGoZJqooJqus7%2BMnaCsqKKkw6Z50a6kqK2iqHqptdJmm56ZpJ0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
