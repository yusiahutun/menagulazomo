The series circled Joe Sandoval (owner of </span><span>Sonoma Valley’s Heritage House Vineyard and the family patriarch) who’s made quite a few enemies on his quest for the American Dream.</span></p><p><span>So, among the multiple characters wanting a piece of that invaluable vineyard (including Joe’s ex-wife Margaret), Andres’ character </span><span>“Carlos Rincón” makes it into the scene as Billy’s brother who initially had a plan of his own to take over the winery.</span></p><p><span>But in his quest to find his brother and work his way upward the winey, Carlos meets Juana Sánchez, a young woman who dreams of becoming a teacher. Together, they then tie their fortunes and pursue a dream of their own.</span></p><p><span>Carlos will certainly develop into an interesting character in the future, and the proof of it is ABC labeling him as </span><i><span>Promised Land</span></i><span>’s “lead” on their official page.</span></p><p><span>Talking about making his debut on a feature film, Andres shared, “My first feature is been a dream come true… It feels like, ‘I don’t need to get paid to do this.’ It’s been the best thing I could have asked for.”</span></p><p><span>As for what got this actor so interesting in the series was its resemblance to a play. “It reminded me of a play almost. It all takes place in one location, very character-driven, the human iteration between them like beings out the story,” Andres explained.</span></p><p><span>Joining Andres this season were his co-stars — Bellamy Young (as Margaret Honeycroft), Cecilia Suárez (as Lettie Sandoval), Christina Ochoa (as Veronica Sandoval), <a href=#>Mariel Molino</a> (as Carmen Sandoval), <a href=#>Tonatiuh Elizarraraz</a> (as Antonio Sandoval), and Augusto Aguilera (as Mateo Flores).</span></p><h3><b>Andres Velez Age</b></h3><p><span>Andres Velez was reportdlty born in Nov 1990.

For instance, when Andres’ movie </span><i><span>Coyote Lake</span></i><span> hit the halls in 2019, the pair made it to the Vintage Cinemas Los Feliz 3, and Lizinke took a pic from that day on IG to caption, “proud of you, love!”</span></p><p><span>Talking more about Andres’s girlfriend, Lizinke is a 5′ 10½” (179 cm) actress who was popular for appearing on TV on shows like </span><i><span>Hermit</span></i><span> (2020), </span><i><span>Mathilda</span></i><span> (2019), </span><i><span>A Secret</span></i><span> (2019), and music videos like The Presets: Do What You Want, Candy Apple Love, Stereo Kids, and a few more.</span></p><p><span>Also, she’s graced theater shows like — Nightwalk in the Chinese Garden, A Memoir of a Warsaw Uprising, All is True, Vinegar Tom, Society, The Glass Menagerie, and Bitter Ters of Petra Von Kant.</span></p><p><span>Lizinke is fluent in Afrikaans and spoke dialects — South African English, Standard American, General American, RP, and MLE.</span></p><h3><b>Andres Velez Height</b></h3><p><span>Andres Velez stands tall at a height of 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm).</span></p><p><span>Mentioning his distinct features, Andres has lightly curled hair, brown eyes, and comparatively smaller lips.</span></p><h3><b>Andres Velez Net Worth</b></h3><p><span>Andres Velez garnered a net worth of under $100 thousand by 2022.</span></p><p><span>An actor by profession, Andres made his feature film debut in the 2022 series </span><i><span>Promised Land</span></i><span>.
