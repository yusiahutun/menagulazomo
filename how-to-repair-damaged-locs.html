Most commonly it can be a result of a poorly done color treatment, side effects of certain medications, an unbalanced diet, stress, and even genetics.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Over-processing, aka excessive hair dye applications on locs, can lead to breakage due to the thinning caused by chemicals in color systems and bleach," she explains. "Those bright vibrant locs require a lift which means removal of layers off the hair shaft, making the loc thinner and weaker. To avoid breakage and damage, opt for milder coloring systems like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Herbatint</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Naturtint</a>."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also recommends giving your hair a break from color sessions every once in a while.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to meds, Lord says that if you've noticed any <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hair thinning</a> or breakage since taking a new prescription, it's fair to assume there may be a connection. However, always make sure to check in with your doctor before coming off any medication, as they may be able to put you on a different treatment plan.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for diet, stress, and genetics, while you can't control the latter, there are lifestyle changes you can make to benefit your hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm a firm believer that we are what we eat, so eat good and drink good," says Lord. "That means plenty of water, juicing with green leafy veggies, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>taking supplements</a>. Get ya vitamin game up to replenish what might be missing from your diet." Lord also stresses the importance of managing stress so that the integrity of your locs is not compromised.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-can-i-reattach-my-broken-locs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How can I reattach my broken locs?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The first step will always be to go see a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>trusted loctician</a> who is trained to work with your hair. Trust us, this isn't something you want to do on your own.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's important to attach the loc with precision so there is no line of demarcation," Lord shares. "Make an appointment with a professional loctician to attach your locs. They will reattach with a crochet needle, braid, wrap, or combination technique."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: 6 Twisted Hairstyle Ideas for Anyone with Natural Hair</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-is-loc-repair-going-to-be-expensive></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Is loc repair going to be expensive?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The level of damage and the loctician you see will dictate how long the service is going to take. Generally speaking, having locs is a lifelong investment, so this isn't necessarily something you should cut corners on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"A loctician will charge hourly, per loc or per service," Lord explains. "As loc repair is a customized service, the prices will vary. Request a consultation from a loctician to get an accurate quote for loc repair needs."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-i-keep-my-locs-healthy-going-forward></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How do I keep my locs healthy going forward?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"As always, the healthy, strong look on the outside comes from the great care of the inside," says Lord. "A bougie, nutritious lifestyle shows up in our skin, hair, and nails." Of course, don't forget to treat your locs from the outside by keeping them cleansed and groomed. "For a refined, shellacked look, loc maintenance is the service. I use Jah Roots Cream ($25; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>jahrootscream.com</a>) for this," comments Lord.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, Lord adds that if you have freeform locs, you can go for the less buttoned-up look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Simple self-desired grooming and massages are the move," she shares. "Less is more when it comes to products for locs." Lord recommends avoiding gel and instead opting for essential oil or oil-based pomade for luster and to conceal moisture. Plus, she states that "routine visits to an experienced loctician is highly recommended."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>All Natural</a>.
