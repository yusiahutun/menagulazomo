After all, gay men usually don’t end up marrying women if they have a choice.&nbsp;</p><p>Owens has been married to the same woman, Michèle Lamy, for over a decade, and their love is still going strong.&nbsp;The pair were introduced by Rick Castro, who Owens used to date, but nothing happened at first.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/milamy.jpg><p>It was not until Castro left the company where three of them worked that Owens started getting closer to Lamy. They ultimately started dating shortly after Lamy’s then-husband started an affair with another woman.&nbsp;Lamy not only made Owens feel loved, but she also inspired him in fashion, and today, the two are recognized as a power couple in the fashion industry.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Rick_Owens_Gay></span>Is Rick Owens Gay?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, Rick Owens is not gay. However, in the past, he used to believe he was 100% gay. Until he met the woman, he fell in love with, Michèle Lamy.&nbsp;</p><p>In a past interview, he said, “So it is true that I am bisexual. That is not supposed to be right?”</p><p>According to him, she made him realize he was bisexual because he completely fell for her and made her his muse.&nbsp;Their marriage remains strong even today despite his revelation of being bisexual. He is also allegedly dating someone outside his marriage. However, Lamy, 18 years his senior, does not seem to mind.&nbsp;</p><p>On the subject of being bisexual, Owens <a href=#>said</a>: “People don’t like that. It would also be great if everything is black or white, but everything in life revolves around ambiguity, and sometimes you must adjust the rules along the way.”</p><p>“It would have been much easier for me, and in fact, I always assumed that I would go through life as 100% gay, without a steady relationship, but with a lot of sex.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Rick_Owens_Wife_Michele_Lamy></span>Who Is Rick Owens’ Wife, Michèle Lamy?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Michèle Lamy is a French designer, fashion icon, performer, film producer, and restaurateur.&nbsp;She is a legendary French culture and fashion figure nearly two decades older than Owens.&nbsp;</p><p>Lamy was an icon in the 90s and was famously known for her tattooed fingers and gold-plated teeth. Owens is by far her longest marriage but not her first.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/lamy-fotor-20230810154458-819x1024.jpg><p>The first man she was married to was experimental filmmaker Richard Newton. Their union lasted from 1990 until they got a divorce in 2003. Three years later, she married Owens.</p><p>Lamy created her self-titled clothing line in 1990. She met Rick Owens when she hired him on Castro’s recommendation, and he later became her business partner.&nbsp;The couple, who got married in 2006, now <a href=#>reside in Paris</a>, happy as can be. Owens doesn’t just consider her as his wife; she is his muse, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Together, they established their fashion company in 2004 and named it Owenscorp. They have described their business partnership as “asking a gypsy to organize a war with a fascist.”</p><p>Other stars like Owens, who swing both ways, include Halsey, Tyler Blackburn, and <a href=#>Megan Fox</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ktrR50aKapGWfrLKvv4ygmLJn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
