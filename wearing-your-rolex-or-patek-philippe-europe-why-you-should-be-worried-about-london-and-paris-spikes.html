Reports of high-end watch robberies, many of them violent, are soaring in cities around the world. This threatens not only consumers, but also the roughly 100 blue-chip Swiss brands whose sales could take a hit if wearing one of their watches suddenly feels scary.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/12/13/6eda2dc4-c59f-43b5-8a2e-0cdcce42aca9_7390c88c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While there are no national statistics on watch theft, authorities in major cities have reported spikes. London’s Metropolitan Police Service launched an operation this summer to address the problem after the number of knifepoint robberies surged 60 per cent between May and June. In Paris, a police task force dedicated to stopping luxury watch theft has grown to 30 agents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is a top priority for us, and we have already made a number of arrests,” said London Detective Chief Superintendent Owain Richards.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Why these women are wearing and collecting expensive men’s watches</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“No one should have to go about their day in fear of thieves,” he added.</p>In London, police data shows that 667 <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Rolex watches</span></a> were taken between January and September. And, in an unfortunate twist on their slogan, “You never actually own a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Patek Philippe</span></a>”, 73 of the luxury Swiss brand’s watches were stolen in the British capital between the start of the year and September, up from 60 over the same period last year.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Robberies aren’t only happening on the streets. Last week, England football star Raheem Sterling rushed home from Qatar after an armed burglary at his house near London, where it seems a US$360,000 watch collection was a target. Mark Cavendish, a cycling pro from the Isle of Man, also had two Richard Mille watches stolen during a burglary of his home in Essex, England, last year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/12/13/b89793d4-9722-4a23-9533-b125180549b6_7390c88c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a sense, watchmakers are victims of their own success. As social media influencers have made six-figure watches more recognisable, thieves have learned which high-end accessories are worth making off with.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2022, the average price of a luxury watch stolen in London was around £9,000 (US$11,000), up from between £4,000 and £5,000 in previous years, according to police data.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When you have a watch like a Richard Mille or an [Audemars Piguet] Royal Oak, [thieves] instantly recognise it,” said Oliver Mueller, head of the Swiss watch consultancy group LuxeConsult. “They’ve seen it on Instagram.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This lifestyle trend has played into a darker phenomenon: YouTube is now filled with security camera footage and bystander videos of people being violently assaulted for their expensive timepieces.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In one clip, a robber rides a moped alongside a luxury car, then smashes the car’s window with a hammer to steal the driver’s watch. In another, a couple are attacked during the day in an affluent area of London.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Collectors have taken notice. “It’s a very bad, very bad image. I don’t know if wealthy people will wear fewer watches, but they are getting more careful,” Mueller said.</p>So far, luxury watch sales have remained relatively strong, although prices for the most sought-after Rolex, Patek and Audemars Piguet watches have been falling sharply since March on the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">secondary market</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Last year, Swiss watch exports rose to a record 22.3 billion francs (US$23.8 billion), according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry, and are on course to break records again in 2022.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For now, watchmakers are keeping an eye on how crime affects sales.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/12/13/f98c45aa-dc4b-40e9-b8c5-637c4718092c_e1cc0418.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are very much aware of the problem,” Rolex said in response to queries. The Geneva-based watch giant controls almost 29 per cent of the luxury Swiss watch market, according to estimates by American financial services company Morgan Stanley, and its annual sales total around US$8.5 billion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Spokesmen for Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet, the maker of the Royal Oak, also said the issue was “of concern”, but declined to comment on how or whether they’re addressing it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Europeans aren’t the only ones on edge: the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said the region saw 206 thefts involving at least one watch valued at US$5,000 or more from the start of the year until mid-November. That marks a nearly 30 per cent increase from the same period in 2021.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Police have blamed the crimes on organised gangs and advised residents to avoid wearing expensive jewellery in public.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Want to buy a Rolex? 6 of the best places to shop online that you can trust</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are definitely seeing examples of robberies and thefts of luxury watches taking place across North America,” said Tannie Ng, a senior underwriter for luxury items at Chubb insurance company.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The return of international travel has probably contributed to the problem. Ng described a situation in which a client flew to Paris for a wedding and was relieved of his Patek Philippe Aquanaut in a daytime mugging.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Luckily, Ng said, the client was fully insured and had even updated his policy to reflect the US$145,000 market value of the watch – a nice windfall from the US$40,000 retail price he had paid for it several years earlier.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/12/13/6f00285c-7c43-4893-9a52-b14f3d3ff972_3af16e17.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In response to such incidents, French law enforcement has put more effort into winding down watch theft.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Paris police commissioner Julien Herbaut, luxury watch robbery fell by 44 per cent this summer in comparison to the year before, despite a major increase in tourists. His team caught 175 watch thieves between January and August, up from 85 over the same period in 2021.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Our investigators have a very sharp knowledge of those criminals and how they operate,” said Herbaut, noting that the less experienced a thief, the more violent a robbery tends to be.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Want a Rolex Daytona or Patek Nautilus 5711? Rare watches flood the market</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Without naming specific brands, the commissioner said French police are in constant dialogue with top Swiss watchmakers – as well as law enforcement officials in Italy and Spain – to share intelligence about stolen goods and the illegal resale market.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Word is spreading among these criminals that the theft of watches is not worth it,” he remarked.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For now, many collectors remain reluctant to wear their prized timepieces out on the town.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/12/13/6ef9dd77-b8ec-4476-9c78-423c2c4366df_8a66ae79.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Adrian Barker, a YouTuber with 250,000 subscribers and co-host of a watch podcast called “About Effing Time”, said he has become more careful about flashing his collection. He keeps his favourite watches – including a gold-and-steel two-tone Rolex GMT-Master II – at home in Scotland, just to be safe.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But he also travels frequently to London. For those trips, Barker has a backup plan: he wears an Apple Watch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdlkpqutsDYaJirrJmYuaZ7kmtnbGhoZ3y4scCroKefXa68tr6Mq6alnahivLN5z5qrnqNdpbWquMipp55llaq%2FsLzEZq6hsV2uvLZ50qGmrqSUYq%2BmedaoqauhlZl6oq7OrqtmpJ%2BjsbC6jJqlnWWglr%2Bqv4ysp6Kjlag%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
