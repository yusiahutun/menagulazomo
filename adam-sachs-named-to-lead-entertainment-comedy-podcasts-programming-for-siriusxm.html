In addition, Sachs worked as an angel investor, startup advisor, and CEO of Midroll Media, the parent company of Earwolf, Howl.fm, Midroll, and Stitcher, which SiriusXM bought for $325 million in 2020.</p><p>“Adam is a leader who has developed more than one podcast company into a top content network with groundbreaking talent and scaled revenue streams,” Greenstein said in a statement. “In this new position, he’ll play a critical role in continuing to grow our premium portfolio of comedy and entertainment programming on SiriusXM and our industry-leading podcast network.”</p><p>The news comes after SiriusXM said it was cutting approximately 8% of its workforce.
