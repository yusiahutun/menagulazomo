Yes!</p><p>The North Carolina native dropped out of college and moved to New York with big dreams of becoming a famous comedian. Zach started performing stand-up anywhere he could, from coffee shops to hamburger joints.</p><p>Before his silver screen success, Zach earned comic cred from stand-up routines which went viral on YouTube. They helped him land the role of <strong>Alan Garner</strong> in the alcohol-fueled flick.</p><p>In honor of the hilarious and proudly Greek actor, we've pulled 10 of his funniest off-screen quotes.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>1. "Well, I have never been much of a groomer. I take baths a lot, but I don't wear deodorant. I don't have to. I have a miraculous body scent. I've had women smell me and say that should be bottled."</p><p>2. "My family has really good senses of humor, even my great aunts in Greece. When you have a 79-year-old great aunt stand on a table while you're eating dinner and squat to show you the correct back position for taking a s--t... I think certain people kind of have it in their blood a little bit to have a sense of humor. You're raised in it."</p><p>3. "I have a lot of growing up to do. I realized that the other day inside my fort."</p><p>4. "My headshot is a scratch and sniff, it smells like failure and onions."</p><p>5. "I'm Greek and I have sinus problems and I know why. My body produces feta cheese. It's not really a joke. It's just a fact...allow me to open up."</p><p>6. "I live in Los Angeles and I had been drinking one night, so I was on the walk of fame and I saw <strong>Tony Danza's</strong> star and I started urinating on it. Just yelling out, 'Who's the boss now?'"</p><p>7. "I like to go to really bad movies in their fourth week, when there's no one but me and one other person in the theater, and I like to sit right next to them. And they're like 'excuse me,' and I'm like 'Shhh...I can't hear <strong>Keanu</strong>."'</p><p>8. "Sometimes, I like to read the bible in public and yell out, 'Oh Bull---t!'"</p><p>9. "I have to stop crying when I watch <strong>"The View."</strong> It's not because of the topics at hand, I just feel sorry for that couch."</p><p>10. "My girlfriend looks a little like<strong> Charlize Theron</strong>, and a lot like <strong>Dog the Bounty Hunter</strong>."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2JlfnN7kGlmaWlfr66ktIygmKWhlp6ur63KoqpmrKWnu7R5k2xkrJ2VYrWqv4yfrKemmZrAtXnQrqatnaNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
