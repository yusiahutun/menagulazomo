Scroll down to see everything you need to know about Nicole, her love life, children, and more.</p><h2>Is Nicole married? Who is her husband?</h2><p>Nicole is not <a href=#>married</a> nor does she have a husband at this time. According to multiple outlets, Nicole was previously hitched to Steve Lane but the two reportedly split in 2009. Following her divorce, she dated Shane Maguire for several years but they ended their relationship and were then subsequently embattled in a custody fight over their son. “I would give anything to have a husband that loved me and supported me and, you know, took the kids out for pizza while I designed, but I just have never had that,” Nicole previously told <a href=#>Country Living</a> magazine.</p><h2>Does Nicole have any children? How many?</h2><p>Yes, Nicole is a mother of two sons. She has an older son named Ethan from her previous marriage to Steve Lane. In May 2015, the TV star <a href=#>gave birth to her second child</a>, a son named Harper. Harper’s dad is Nicole’s former partner Shane Maguire. In her memoir [Better Than New](<a href=#>https://www.amazon.com/Better-Than-New-Lessons-Learned/dp/1579656676/ref=sr</a>11?tag=countrylivingauto-append-20&ascsubtag=countryliving.article.42610)_, Nicole revealed that she learned she was pregnant with her second baby shortly after her 38th birthday. When she told her then-boyfriend, Shane, his reaction was not what she expected.</p><p>“I had wanted my fabulous Mister to look at me with tears in his eyes and say what I was thinking: that this was the greatest thing we’d never asked for,” she wrote. Sadly, Nicole and Shane ended their relationship soon after <a href=#>Nicole revealed she was expecting</a> and then had a messy custody battle over Harper.</p><h2>What happened with Nicole’s custody battle?</h2><p>Six months after Harper’s birth, Shane first sued Nicole for joint custody of their son — and the former couple has been in court ever since <a href=#>battling several different disputes</a>. For her part, Nicole requested to have the records of her paternity case sealed from the public and asked a judge to disallow Shane from having overnight visits with Harper until he turned two years old. Both requests were denied in court.</p><p>“I never knew a <a href=#>nursing baby could be separated</a> from their mother. If someone took puppies from their mom at two weeks, people would be in an uproar,” Nicole recently told Country Living of the situation. “My life is absolutely not perfect. The most important thing for me is to be strong for my children. I’ve never enjoyed the moment because I know it can go away at any time.”</p><p>In late November 2017, she admitted that she’s “in the process of weaning” her son off of breastfeeding because of the custody battle. Her ex has badmouthed her choice to continue until her son was 2.5 years old “in an attempt to humiliate and embarrass” her, she said in court docs obtained by <a href=#>The Blast</a>.</p><h2>Where does Nicole live?</h2><p>For the past three years, Nicole was living in a newly-renovated 1904 home in Detroit. However, Shane is now accusing her of moving from Michigan to California to keep him from seeing his son, <a href=#>The Blast</a> reported on Sunday, March 18. He said he recently showed up to her Detroit abode to pick up Harper, and when he texted her to say he was there, she claimed she doesn’t have a house in Michigan, which Shane says is a “blatant lie.”</p><p>Shane lives in Minnesota, and in September 2017, told Nicole he would move to Michigan to be closer to Harper. He claims that Nicole then “began scheming her next move” to California without telling him, which frustrated him because he says he would have moved to California if he had known her plans.</p><p>Shane wrote an email to his lawyer that read, “Now I sit here alone in Michigan where Nicole chose to run the day before Harper’s due date, gave birth to him and where she has remained almost three years. She argued many times that I should not make Harper travel and wrote as much (many times) to her social media groups. So, I moved my life to accommodate and make it easier for Harper.”</p><p>The note continued, “Now my son is somewhere in California instead of here with me. This is just not healthy for a three-year-old! Nor for me for that matter. It’s breaking my heart and I can’t take much more of it! I can’t sleep and wake in the middle of the night in anguish for Harper’s wee heart. Shane added, “How does she keep getting away with this? This is a crucial time in Harper’s life and Nicole Curtis is eating that time up with her inability to be a selfless, caring mother.”</p><p>He’s also claiming that she’s done this exact same thing once before with her other son’s father “without the thought of what was best for her son.” Awkward…</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46noJynnJp6pMHRraCsZZ2Wv7O1xJ1km5mSrnqps9OvZKudmJavbq3DnaCcrF1mgHF%2FlGtm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
