But who was I to know?" she said.</p><p>After Applegate received her diagnosis in the summer of 2021, production on the third and final season of "Dead to Me" was halted for about five months so she could start undergoing treatment.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:689a950d-e3d3-4fca-bb8f-d307854be1db data-container-ref=toofab:article:f8b0d8c2-a4a6-41cc-b74a-93e5fc028a26 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/4b/5by4/2022/11/02/4bae62253cdf4425ba9b9b551e66d725_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Netflix</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Dead to Me Final Season Trailer Finds Christina Applegate & Linda Cardellini Back In Hot Water</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"There was the sense of, 'Well, let’s get her some medicine so she can get better," she told the NY Times. "And there is no better. But it was good for me. I needed to process my loss of my life, my loss of that part of me. So I needed that time."</p><p>"Although it’s not like I came on the other side of it, like, 'Woohoo, I’m totally fine,'" she said. "Acceptance? No. I'm never going to accept this. I'm pissed."</p><p>Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. It can impact the flow of information from the brain to the body -- though it manifests differently in different patients -- and is incurable.</p><p>Despite her illness, the Emmy winner said she was determined to finish shooting the show, noting that she felt that she "had an obligation" to the show's creator Liz Feldman and her co-star Linda Cardellini.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:7cf3032d-1dd9-4faa-bf3e-3da01e5b7496 data-container-ref=toofab:article:f8b0d8c2-a4a6-41cc-b74a-93e5fc028a26 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/45/5by4/2022/10/28/4590a90a408348e682d56fe41171d4c1_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Christina Applegate Shares 'Fancy' Cane Options Ahead of First Event Since MS Diagnosis</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"The powers that be were like, 'Let's just stop. We don't need to finish it. Let's put a few episodes together,'" she recalled. "I said, 'No. We're going to do it, but we're going to do it on my terms.'"</p><p>Although she insisted on pushing through so the show could have a worthy conclusion, Applegate admitted that she likely won't watch the final season.</p><p>"If people hate it, if people love it, if all they can concentrate on is, 'Ooh, look at the cripple,' that's not up to me," she said. "I'm sure that people are going to be, like, 'I can’t get past it.' Fine, don’t get past it, then. But hopefully people can get past it and just enjoy the ride and say goodbye to these two girls."</p><p>The final season of "Dead to Me" hits Netflix on November 17.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:2ed70710-54d8-4d18-ba0f-7d8ec862c997 data-container-ref=toofab:article:f8b0d8c2-a4a6-41cc-b74a-93e5fc028a26 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f6/5by4/2022/10/14/f66a659e0d87400796bc9d04e8cb45d3_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">9 Celebrities Who Opened Up About Their MS Battle</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGpmaWtfmLWztdKtoKeZXZa9sbjEoJitnV2qu6Kuy55kraddrL%2BqwMRmnaiqXaWutMCMa2SynZGnwG6w1J5kraddosBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
