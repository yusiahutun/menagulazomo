Can I reject a speeding ticket after 14 days? When you're issued a speeding ticket, you'll receive a Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) and a Section 172 notice.
You may have heard that if you get a speeding ticket through the post 14 days after you were caught, that the ticket can be cancelled, but it is more complicated than that."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

ticket</a>, you'll receive a Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) and a Section 172 notice.</p><p>You may have heard that if you get a speeding ticket through the post 14 days after you were caught, that the ticket can be <a href=#>cancelled</a>, but it is more complicated than that.</p><p>The <a href=#>police</a> will need to be able to show that the ticket should have reached you within 14 days under normal circumstances.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON SPEEDING">READ MORE ON SPEEDING</h2><p>This means the letter could go to an old address if you’ve not <a href=#>updated your licence</a>, it could go to a hire company or your work address if the vehicle isn’t yours.</p><p>Even if the ticket goes to one of these wrong addresses within 14 days, the attempt has been made to reach you and therefore it is still valid, even if it actually takes slightly longer to get to you.</p><p>Similarly, delays caused by problems within the <a href=#>postal service</a> don't affect the rule, meaning if it was posted in time for a normal service to get to you, it won't sway the courts.</p><p>The day that you are <a href=#>caught</a> is not included within the 14 day period.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Motors</h2></p><p>For example, if the speeding incident happened on January 1 and the speeding ticket arrives to you on January 16, you will have grounds to contest.</p><h2>Does the 14 day rule apply if the letter goes to the wrong address?</h2><p>The address where your car is registered is where the letter will be sent to be the <a href=#>DVLA</a>.</p><p>If you have recently changed <a href=#>the address</a> and it is sent to the previous one, you may have grounds to challenge it and avoid being given an increased fine.</p><p>However, if you have not updated your address but the letter is sent to your old address, the attempts have been made to reach you and therefore the fine would stand.</p><p>Also, if your address details are correct and the fine was issued within the first 14 days then it can't be rejected.</p><h2>When can I challenge a speeding fine?</h2><p>The first thing you need to do is reply to the <a href=#>speeding ticket</a> with a not guilty plea.</p><p>You'll then be summoned to a <a href=#>court</a> hearing.</p><p>However, challenging a speeding ticket can be difficult if you don't have the correct evidence.</p><p>You could challenge it if the notice was incorrect, for example if you weren't driving when the alleged <a href=#>offence</a> took place.</p><p>Challenges also won't be accepted if the ticket issue has spelling mistakes or minor mistakes such as the colour of the vehicle.</p><p>It's also tricky to challenge the evidence of the <a href=#>camera</a> itself unless you can prove the camera was faulty.</p><p>It could be challenged on the basis the speed measuring equipment hadn't been calibrated or was being misused.</p><p>However, it's unlikely this tactic would be successful.</p><h2>What is the penalty for not paying a speeding fine?</h2><p>There are two ways of failing to pay a fine on a fixed penalty notice.</p><p>You can either rejected the fixed penalty notice from the start and you'll receive a summons to go to court.</p><p>You could face a heftier fine and receive more points if the court decides you're guilty of <a href=#>speeding</a>.</p><p>The amount you're fined will be affected on what the speed limit was and how much <a href=#>over it</a> you were when driving.</p><p>The fine is also usually a percentage of your weekly income and a maximum of £1000.</p><p>However, this can be a maximum of £2,500 if you were driving on a <a href=#>motorway</a>.</p><p>In some cases, you can even be <a href=#>disqualified</a> from driving or have your license suspended.</p><p>Or you can be penalised if you accept the penalty notice but then fail to pay within 28 days.</p><p>The fine will be registered with the court and will automatically increase by 50 per cent.</p><p>It is then for the court to enforce the fine and they do have the option of issuing a warrant for your arrest if you fail to respond.</p><h2>What is the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988?</h2><p>Under the <a href=#>Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988</a>, anyone who is to be prosecuted for:</p><ul><li>dangerous, careless or inconsiderate driving</li><li>failure to comply with <a href=#>traffic signs</a> or the direction of a police officer on traffic duty</li><li>leaving a vehicle in a dangerous position</li><li>speeding (if it is not dealt with under the fixed penalty system)</li></ul><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>can only be convicted of the offence if they were warned at the time of the offence that a prosecution would be considered.</p><p>Or if a written Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) specifying the offence and its time and place was served on them or the registered keeper of the vehicle within 14 days of the offence.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxygpJxbGpqYWS%2FprbEnKtmq6CasqW1zaBkraGToLK1eZBtZJ2Zqah8</p><footer
