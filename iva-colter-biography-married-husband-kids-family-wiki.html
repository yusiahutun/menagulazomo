In most quarters it is still supported in hushed tones, in others, it is supported more blatantly. Iva Colter is, by any definition, a consummate woman, but, sadly, she entered national consciousness because of the strange reaction on live television when it became known that she was the wife of actor Mike Colter. Some people were not impressed that Mike would marry a white woman.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Iva Colter Biography</strong></h2><p>Iva Colter was born on 25 April 1975 as Iva Popovicova in New Jersey. She holds a Master of Arts, Gender and Culture from the Central European University and a doctorate from the State University of New Jersey-New Brunswick. Very little is known about Eva’s parents and siblings, as she leads a very private life.</p><p>After Iva left university, she worked as a senior management consultant from 2006 to 2012. Her next post was a management position as Assistant Vice-President of Recruitment at Ares Management. She held this position for two years, after which she merged with Netflix Inc. in 2014 as Manager of Talent Acquisition.</p><p>Barely 18 months after joining Netflix, she was promoted to her current position as Director of Talent Acquisition. In this role, she oversees the development and execution of recruitment strategies, oversees recruitment processes, and identifies high-potential human resources for Netflix.

Husband, Kids, and Family</strong></h2><p>Iva Colter feels most at home in a boardroom or a group of students but is married to a much more famous and extravagant personality. Iva is married to the actor Mike Colter. The couple met at Rutgers University, where Iva earned a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature and Mike was pursuing a master’s degree in acting.</p><p>Mike Colter made his acting debut in the television series ER in 2002, in 2004 he played the role of Big Willie Little alongside Clint Eastwood in a Million Dollar Baby, a year later he appeared in Law & Order, Silver Bells, and 2007 in the film And Then Came Love.</p><p>In 2010, Mike served as CIA Tactical Director in the film Salt, where he had the opportunity to work with Academy Award-winning actress <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a>. Mike also starred in the 2012 film Men in Black, starring as Colonel James Darrell Edwards, and played Operative Mike in Kathryn Bigelow’s film Zero Dark Thirty. After all the hype, he starred in The Good Wife, which earned him the interesting and recurring role of Lemond Bishop, a complex, sexy, drug-dealing business mogul.</p><p>Mike has since appeared in many other movies, including Agent Jameson Locke in the Halo franchise, Miles Lathem in Agent X, and Luke Cage in Marvel’s Jessica Jones. He will resume his role as Luke Cage in Marvel’s Luke Cage on Netflix.</p><p>Mike Colter was a guest on the Wendy Williams Show, and unfortunately, some of his fans were unhappy that he had married a white woman. When the photo of Mike and his wife Iva was shown, some members of the audience stopped cheering. The same audience that screamed and cheered when Mike entered the show showed no reaction after the photo was shown.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Josh Brener Wife, Married, Gay, Girlfriend, Height, Biography</a></strong></p><p>In a later interview, when he was questioned about the incident on the Wendy Williams Show, a visibly offended Colter shot back at the haters and said that he loved his wife very much and that this had nothing to do with the race. In his opinion, nobody should be judged by his race, but by the virtues and values, he stands for. Mike explained how he met his wife when he was having trouble at school and didn’t have much to offer. He told how she stood by him during those hard years.</p><p>The couple have been married since 2016, although they’ve been together for almost 17 years and together they have a lovely daughter – Niles Colter</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ktretjJympayVp3qjtc6gqZqomK56rq3Rq6CenF2dwrSuwKebZqOZmcBussCmoKWxXay2rLWO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
