Those things just cook you! So have you ever wondered exactly what temperature your CPU is running at?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Neither Windows 10 nor Windows 11 has a built-in way to see your computer's CPU temperature, so you'll need a third-party program for this. (However, it may be displayed in your computer's <a href=#>UEFI firmware or BIOS</a>.) There are quite a few Windows programs&nbsp;that you can use to monitor the temperature. Here are two of our favorite options.</p><h2 id=for-basic-cpu-temperature-monitoring-core-temp>For Basic CPU Temperature Monitoring: Core Temp</h2><p>The most important temperature to measure in your computer is <a href=#>the processor, or CPU</a>. Core Temp is a simple, lightweight app that runs in your system tray and monitor's the temperature of your CPU without cluttering it up with other stuff. It offers a few different options so you can customize it to your tastes, and even works with <a href=#>other programs like Rainmeter</a>.</p><p><a href=#>Download Core Temp from its home page</a> and install it on your computer. We've <a href=#>used it on Windows 11</a>, Windows 10, Windows 8, and Windows 7, and it works well on all of them.</p><p>Be very careful to uncheck the bundled software on the third page of the installation! While the program is free and works well, it tries to bundle junkware in its installer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/coretempcrapware.png><p>When you run Core Temp, it will appear as an icon or series of icons in your system tray showing the temperature of your CPU. If your CPU has multiple cores (as most modern CPUs do), it will show multiple icons--one for each core.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/screenshot.1-2.png><p>Right-click on the icon to show or hide the main window. It will give you a bunch of information about your CPU, including the model, speed, and temperature of each of its cores.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/screenshot.1-2.png><p>Take particular note of the "TJ. Max" value, if one is displayed here. This is the highest&nbsp;temperature (in Celsius) at which the manufacturer has rated your CPU to run. If&nbsp;your CPU is anywhere near that temperature, it is considered overheating. (Usually, it's best to keep it at least 10 to 20 degrees lower than that---and even then, if you're anywhere close, it usually means something is wrong unless you've overclocked your CPU.)</p><p>For most modern CPUs, Core Temp should be able to detect the Tj. Max for your specific processor. To double-check, note the model name and number of your processor displayed under "Processor Information" in the Core Temp window and search for its maximum temperature online. Every processor is a little different, and having an accurate Tj. Max value is very important, as it ensures you're getting the correct temperature readings for your CPU.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To configure some of Core Temp's more useful features, head to Options > Settings. Here are a few settings we recommend looking at:</p><ul><li><strong>General > Start Core Temp with Windows</strong>: You can turn this on or off; it's up to you. Turning it on will allow you to monitor your temperatures at all times without having to remember to start it up. But if you only need the app occasionally, it's okay to turn this off.</li><li><strong>Display > Start Core Temp minimized</strong>: You'll probably want to turn this on if you have "Start Core Temp with Windows" on.</li><li><strong>Display > Hide Taskbar Button</strong>: Again, if you're going to leave it running all the time, this is good to turn on so it doesn't waste space on your taskbar.</li><li><strong>Notification Area&nbsp;> Notification Area Icons</strong>: This allows you to customize how Core Temp appears in your notification area (or system tray, as it's commonly called.) You can choose to display just the app's icon or display the temperature of your CPU. We recommend the "highest temperature" (instead of "all cores", which will show multiple icons.) You can also customize the font and colors here.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/screenshot.1-2.png><p>If the icon is only appearing in the pop-up tray and you want to see it at all times, just <a href=#>click and drag it onto your taskbar</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/screenshot.1-2.png><p>If you decide to show the temperature in the notification area, you may want to&nbsp;change the Temperature Polling Interval in the General tab of Core Temp's settings. By default, it's set to&nbsp;1000 milliseconds, but you can move it higher if the blinking numbers annoy you. Just remember that, the higher you set it, the more time it'll take for Core Temp to notify you if your CPU is running hot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Core Temp can do a lot more than this---you can head to Options > Overheat Protection to have your computer alert you when it reaches its maximum safe temperature, for example---but these basics should be all you need to keep an eye on your CPU temperatures.</p><h2 id=for-advanced-monitoring-across-your-entire-system-hwmonitor><strong>For Advanced Monitoring&nbsp;Across Your Entire System: HWMonitor</strong></h2><p>Generally, your CPU temperatures are going to be the most important temperatures to monitor. But, if you want to see temperatures across your system--motherboard, CPU, graphics card, and hard drives---<a href=#>HWMonitor</a> gives you that and much more.</p><p>Download the "classic" version from <a href=#>the HWMonitor home page</a>. We recommend the ZIP version, which doesn't require installation, though you can also download the full setup version if you want. Start it up, and you'll be greeted with a&nbsp;table of temperatures, fan speeds, and other values.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>To find your CPU temperature, scroll down to the entry for your CPU---in the screenshots here, for example, ours is an "Intel Core i7 4930K"---and look at the "Core #" temperatures in the list.</p><p>(Note that "Core Temperature" is different than "CPU Temp", which&nbsp;will appear under the motherboard section for some PCs. Generally, you'll want to monitor the Core temperature. See our note below about AMD temperatures for more info.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Feel free to poke around and see temperatures for other components in your system, too. For example, you will likely see temperatures for your <a href=#>GPU</a> and any <a href=#>solid-state drives</a> in your computer. There isn't much else you can do with HWMonitor, but it's a good program to have around.</p><h2 id=a-note-on-amd-processor-temperatures>A Note on AMD Processor Temperatures</h2><p>Monitoring temperatures for AMD processors has long puzzled computer enthusiasts.&nbsp;Unlike most Intel processors, <a href=#>AMD machines will report two temperatures</a>: "CPU Temperature" and "Core Temperature."</p><p>"CPU Temperature" is an actual temperature sensor inside the&nbsp;CPU's socket.&nbsp;"Core Temperature", on the other hand, isn't really a temperature at all. It's an arbitrary scale&nbsp;measured in degrees celsius designed to, in a way, mimic a temperature sensor.</p><p>Your BIOS will often show the CPU Temperature, which may differ from programs like Core Temp, which show Core Temperature. Some programs, like HWMonitor, show both.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>CPU Temperature is more accurate at low levels, but less so at high levels. Core Temperature is more accurate when your CPU&nbsp;gets hot, which is when temperature values really matter. So, in almost all cases, you'll want to pay attention to Core Temperature. When your system is idle, it may show impossibly low temperatures (like 15 degrees celsius), but once things heat up a bit, it will show a more accurate--and useful--value.</p><h2 id=what-to-do-if-you-don-t-get-a-reading-or-temperatures-look-really-wrong><strong>What to Do If You Don't Get a Reading (or Temperatures&nbsp;Look Really Wrong)</strong></h2><p>In some cases, you may find that one of the above programs&nbsp;doesn't quite work. Maybe it doesn't match up with another temperature-monitoring program, maybe it's absurdly low, or maybe you can't get a temperature at all.</p><p>There are a lot of reasons this could happen, but here are a few things to check:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li>Are you looking at the right sensors? If two programs don't agree, it's possible---especially on AMD machines---that one program is reporting the "Core temperature" and one is reporting the "CPU temperature". Make&nbsp;sure you're comparing apples to apples. Core temperature is usually what you want to monitor, as we mentioned above.</li><li>Make sure your&nbsp;programs are up-to-date. If you're using an old version of Core Temp, for example, it may not support your CPU, in which case it won't provide an accurate temperature (or possibly won't even provide a temperature at all). Download the latest version&nbsp;to see if it fixes the problem. If you have a very new CPU, you may need to wait for an update to the program.</li><li>How old is your computer? If it's more than a few years old, it may not be supported by programs like Core Temp.</li></ul><p>We could write a book about monitoring CPU temperatures, but in the interest of keeping this easy to follow, we'll leave it at that. Hopefully, you can get a general estimate of how well your CPU is being cooled.</p><h2 id=how-to-monitor-gpu-temperature>How to Monitor GPU Temperature</h2><p>You may also be interested in keeping an eye on your GPU temperature. While Core Temp doesn't display this information---it's all about CPU temperatures---HWMonitor does.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, you don't need any third-party software to check your GPU temperature on Windows 10 or Windows 11. Since <a href=#>Windows 10's May 2020 Update</a>, the Task Manager has displayed GPU temperature information.</p><p>To find it, open your Task Manager. The quickest way to do so is by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Esc, although you can also press Ctrl+Alt+Delete and click "Task Manager" or search for the "Task Manager" shortcut in your Start menu and launch it.</p><p>In the Task Manager, click the "Performance" Tab. (If you don't see it, click "More Details" at the bottom.) Your GPU temperature will be displayed under the GPU name in the left column.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Show Windows 10's Hidden Floating Performance Panels</a></span></p><p>To keep the Performance pane always on screen as <a href=#>a floating performance monitor</a>, you can use "Summary View." Right-click in the Performance pane and select "Summary View" to activate it---or just double-click in the left pane. Click Options > Always on Top first if you want to keep the floating pane <a href=#>always on top</a> of other windows.</p><p>The Task Manager will let you <a href=#>monitor which programs are using the most GPU resources</a>, too.</p><h2 id=what-to-do-if-you-suspect-your-pc-is-overheating>What to Do If you Suspect Your PC Is Overheating</h2><p>Monitoring your temperatures is good, and something everyone should check on once in a while. But if your computer is regularly overheating, there's probably a deeper cause that you need to look into. <a href=#>Open up the Task Manager</a> and see if there are any&nbsp;processes using&nbsp;your CPU, and stop them (or figure out why they're out of control).&nbsp;Make sure that you aren't blocking any of the vents on your computer, <a href=#>especially if it's a laptop</a>. <a href=#>Blow the vents out with compressed air</a> to make sure they aren't filled with dust and dirt. The older and dirtier a computer gets, the harder the fans have to work to keep the temperature down--which means a hot computer and very loud fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhoaWtlZLK3sdFmrqimlJq%2FbsPHmqtmrJWivaa%2BwK2sq51drry2voycp65lmah6s8HNp6Cnn12WwXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
