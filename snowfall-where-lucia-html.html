What happened to Lucia in 'Snowfall?' It's one of the biggest questions plaguing fans of the hit FX series, which focuses on the spread of crack cocaine around 1980s Los Angeles. But we're starting to get answers.
Published on August 4, 2021   2 min read Another season of Snowfall has come and gone without any sign of Lucia Villanueva. Played by actor Emily Rios, she’s the daughter of a leader of a Mexican drug cartel with hopes of taking the family business to the next level."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

What happened to Lucia in Snowfall?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Emily-Rios-and-Sergio-Peris-Mencheta.jpg><h2 id=h-lucia-s-whereabouts-are-still-a-mystery-but-perhaps-not-for-long>Lucia’s whereabouts are still a mystery, but perhaps not for long</h2><p id=par-2_56>The last time we saw Lucia was at the end of season 2, when she and Oso had just been attacked by Conejo. After him fighting off, Lucia rushed to aid a severely wounded Oso, pleading for him to not die. By pure luck, he lived, but by the time he recovered, Lucia was gone.</p><p id=par-3_58>Refusing to accept claims that she’s not coming back, Oso dedicated much of his time across the next episodes to finding Lucia. Finally, at the end of Snowfall Season 4, he learned from Teddy McDonald’s former colleague at the CIA that they’ve found her. While Lucia and Oso have yet to reconnect, <a href=#>it’s possible they could next season</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-what-else-to-expect-in-snowfall-season-5>What else to expect in ‘Snowfall’ Season 5</h2><p id=par-4_36>The season 4 finale also saw Franklin Saint (Damson Idris) send Alton Williams (Kevin Carroll) away to Cuba. That was one of his last big problems in the show but, of course, more chaos is ahead.</p><p id=par-5_74>“We’re going to probably, it looks like, jump forward a little bit in time, more than we have maybe in the past to get into the meat of 1986 when the violence was really ramping up, when you really started to feel the full militarization of the LAPD, when the War on Drugs was on its way to reaching its apex,” Snowfall co-creator Dave Andron previously told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gold Derby</a> about the season 5 plot.</p><p id=par-6_47>“And then this kind of pop culture explosion that was brimming in South Central — the rise of gangster rap and you had ‘Straight Outta Compton’ and those things getting ready to drop and blow up. It’s a huge sea change moment for the neighborhood,” he continued.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_48>“And so without getting into too much character stuff, I will just say from the standpoint of history and kind of where we are in the arc of this thing, it’s a really exciting time for us to plop our characters into and see what happens,” Andron added.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-when-does-snowfall-season-5-come-out>When does ‘Snowfall’ Season 5 come out?</h2><p id=par-8_83>As of writing, there’s no release date for <a href=#>Snowfall Season 5</a>, but work on it has already started. In the interview with Gold Derby, Andron mentioned the writing team was already cooking up ideas for the next episodes. Keeping in mind the time it can take to write, shoot, and edit a show, we guess Snowfall could come back sometime in 2022. But it’s truly too early to tell.
