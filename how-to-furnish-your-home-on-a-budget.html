With the Swedish homeware store stocking everything from bed frames to rattan wicker baskets at an affordable price, it's tempting to get everything in one go. If this is your jam, roll with it. If you're like me, however, you'll prefer to add a *little bit of spice* to your interior design.</p><p id=e_BPQEQrkSdD data-wc=31>If you're preparing for a move and are worried about the endless costs of furniture, I managed to furnish my one-bedroom flat for under £1000 using these handy tips and tricks…</p><h2>Thrift furniture on Facebook Marketplace</h2><p id=etISjDMoAli- data-wc=44>Even if you no longer use your Facebook account, it's worth delving into the world of Facebook Marketplace if you're looking to find affordable second-hand furniture. Sales and exchanges happen remarkably quickly on Marketplace, the social media app's platform that helps users sell locally.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/013a836280ab-vintage-furniture-z.jpg><p id=eQapi8QT6n_Z data-wc=50>If you're weeks away from your new lease and concerned about your furnishing budget, Facebook Marketplace is a haven for cheap pieces. Given the fast-paced nature of the app, you'll often find that several pieces of furniture are going away for free for those willing to collect within the day.</p><p id=e9s4Dm9VrYpk data-wc=34>For items that do have a price, try your hand at haggling. Offering a reasonable price to a seller keen to shift their pre-loved homeware is often more successful than not (in our experience).</p><p id=eXosyGzayVZk data-wc=10><strong>LOOK: <a class=hm-link href=#>Best vintage furniture shops in London for one-off pieces</a></strong></p><h2>Hunt charity shops for home bargains</h2><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eZn7IF-mg4CT data-wc=61>Furniture shopping in charity shops requires an open mind, patience, and an excellent eye for spotting potential. When you've nailed these traits, the opportunities for sourcing unique, vintage furniture may not make your home worthy of a spread in Architectural Digest, but it will promise a homely space full of retro, mid-century and antique treasures you simply cannot find in IKEA.</p><p id=eyyBUvXOaGXP data-wc=43>Even if you find something that doesn't match your exact taste, the possibilities are endless for upcycling. It's worth noting that even after buying materials to paint, upholster or embellish your thrifted furniture, it's still normally a cheaper process overall than buying new.</p><p id=eP58JWScS79U data-wc=34>We'd recommend visiting your local charity shops regularly ahead of your big move to ensure you've nabbed the best finds.

Particularly if you're renting, furnishing your home with things that suit your taste creates a homely and warm environment without needing to breach your tenancy agreement.</p><h2>Work with what you have</h2><p id=egu7YZ1EutJg data-wc=29>If you're conscious about the environment, you may have heard the saying: "the most sustainable wardrobe is the one you already own." Well, the same goes for your furniture.</p><p id=efcx-okK7r3Z data-wc=63>Wherever possible, look to what you already have to see if you can avoid re-purchasing. If you're working with larger pieces of furniture, things like sofas can always be upholstered with affordable slip covers, while soft furnishing like duvets typically lasts for up to five years, so your old duvet may not need to be repurchased just for the sake of moving home.</p><h2>Buy a refurbished mattress</h2><p id=erzcdYe_ujvl data-wc=59>If the thought of sleeping on a second-hand bed makes you recoil, you'll likely reconsider when you learn that most refurbished mattresses have been returned as part of a 30-day trial.
