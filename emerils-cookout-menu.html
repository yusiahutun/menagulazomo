This allows for guests to get creative with how they dress up their grilled hot dog. <strong>Emeril’s top tip:</strong> Use a seasoning, like Emeril’s Original Essence (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Amazon, $6.89</a>), when making the cheese sauce. “It’s an all-purpose seasoning, so it really gives a little sense of depth while you use it and cook with it,” he notes.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Ingredients:</h3><p><strong>Jalapeno Cheese Sauce:</strong></p><ul><li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li><li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li><li>½ teaspoon salt</li><li>½ teaspoon Emeril’s Original Essence</li><li>3 cups milk</li><li>1 ½ cups shredded Colby cheese</li><li>¾ cup jalapeño slices, drained, chopped</li></ul><p><strong>Hot Dogs:</strong></p><ul><li>8 all beef hot dogs</li><li>8 hot dog buns</li><li>2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil</li></ul><p><strong>Toppings (optional):</strong></p><ul><li>Diced onion</li><li>Sauerkraut</li><li>Mustard</li><li>Ketchup</li><li>Relish</li><li>Hot sauce</li><li>Barbecue sauce</li><li>Diced tomatoes</li><li>Sliced iceberg lettuce</li><li>Chili</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Directions:</h3><ul><li><strong>Active:</strong> 40 mins</li><li><strong>Total time: &nbsp;</strong>40 mins&nbsp;+ grill prep</li><li><strong>Yield:</strong>&nbsp;8 servings&nbsp;</li></ul><li><strong>Jalapeño Cheese Sauce:</strong>&nbsp;In medium skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour. Season with salt and Emeril’s Original Essence. Cook, stirring, 2 minutes; slowly whisk in milk. Bring to boil; reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens enough to coat back of spoon, about 20 minutes. Add cheese and jalapeño; whisk until melted. Remove from heat; transfer to bowl. Serve warm (sauce can be covered and chilled for up to 2 days, then reheated on low, with a little liquid added if needed).</li><li><strong>Hot Dogs:&nbsp;</strong>Prepare well-oiled grill for medium-high direct- heat cooking. Grill hot dogs, covered, until marked on all sides and heated through, 4 to 5 minutes, or until desired doneness.

Once hot, add onion and garlic; cook, stirring, until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add vinegar; cook until reduced by half, about 1 min. Add next 10 ingredients; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; cook until thickened and flavors blend, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from heat; let cool. Reserve for glazing ribs.</li><li>Line rimmed baking sheet with foil; set rack on top. Arrange ribs on rack. Coat ribs on both sides generously with rib rub (about&nbsp;⅓&nbsp;cup each), rubbing seasonings into meat. Chill up to 2 hours.</li><li>Prepare grill for low-heat cooking (300 to 350 degrees Fahrenheit). Pour 1 ½&nbsp;cups water onto baking sheet with ribs. Wrap baking sheet (with rack and ribs) tightly with heavy duty foil. Grill, covered, until fork-tender, 1 ½ to 2 hours. Unwrap; brush with BBQ Sauce. Grill, covered, until sauce sets, 15 to 20 minutes. If desired, serve with additional sauce.</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kicked Up Blue Cheese Stuffed Hamburgers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/Cookout-Menu-Image_Kicked-Up-Blue-Cheese-Stuffed-Hamburgers.jpg><p>For a classic burger with a twist, try these blue-cheese burgers. The juicy meat pairs well with the cheese’s earthy taste. <strong>Emeril’s top tip:</strong> Stuff the burgers with other kinds of cheese if you’re not a fan of blue cheese. “You could use Feta, or goat cheese, you could use Havarti…I even use Brie. Brie’s an excellent cheese to stuff the burger with,” he suggests.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Ingredients:</h3><ul><li>2 pounds ground beef chuck</li><li>1 tablespon minced garlic</li><li>1 teaspoon salt</li><li>½&nbsp;teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li><li>1 teaspoon Creole seasoning, such as Emeril’s</li><li>8 ounces blue cheese</li><li>4 large whole-wheat buns, split in half</li><li>Optional: Diced tomatoes, romaine, sliced onions, and green peppercorn mayonnaise</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Directions:</h3><ul><li><strong>Active:</strong> 30 mins</li><li><strong>Total time:</strong> 30 mins&nbsp;+ grill prep</li><li><strong>Yield:</strong> 4 servings&nbsp;</li></ul><li>Prepare grill for medium-high direct- heat cooking. In bowl, gently mix<br>beef, garlic, salt, pepper and seasoning. Divide into 8 equal patties.</li><li>In separate bowl, crumble cheese and form into 4 equal patties. Place one cheese patty on each of 4 beef patties. Top with remaining beef patties, pinching edges to seal. Grill patties, flipping once, 2 to 3 minutes per side for medium-rare or to desired doneness. Place buns on grill, cut side down; cook until warmed through, about 30 seconds. Place patties in buns. Garnish as desired.</li><li><strong>Note:</strong> Instead of grilling the patties, Emeril says you can cook them in a skillet on the stovetop over medium-high heat until they reach your desired level of doneness.</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Spiced Honey Barbecue Chicken</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/Cookout-Menu-Image_Spiced-Honey-Barbecue-Chicken.jpg><p>These tender chicken wings are marinated in a sweet and savory marinade that doubles as the meat’s glaze — a win-win. <strong>Emeril’s top tip:</strong> When reducing the marinade into a glaze, use a nonstick pot so the mixture doesn’t cling to the surface. “My comfort zone with cookware is nonstick, really good <a href=#>nonstick that you can take care of</a> and don’t even have to put them in the dishwasher,” he explains. “Although they are dishwasher-safe, just hand-wash them with hot soapy water, rinse them out good and they will last you a long time.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Ingredients:</h3><ul><li>1 cup soy sauce</li><li>¾ cup finely chopped yellow onion</li><li>⅓ cup rice wine vinegar</li><li>¼ cup honey</li><li>¼ cup chopped cilantro</li><li>2 tablespoons sriracha</li><li>2 tablespoons chopped, peeled fresh ginger</li><li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li><li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li><li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li><li>12 skin-on drumettes or chicken thighs (about 3 ½&nbsp;pounds)</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Directions:</h3><ul><li><strong>Active:</strong> 50 mins</li><li><strong>Total time:</strong> 7 hrs&nbsp;+ grill prep</li><li><strong>Yield:</strong> 6 servings&nbsp;</li></ul><li>In large bowl, stir together first 10 ingredients. Place chicken in large plastic food- storage bag; add marinade. Toss to combine; Chill, turning frequently, at least 6 hrs.</li><li>Prepare grill for medium direct-heat cooking. Heat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Remove chicken from marinade; reserve marinade. Pat chicken dry. Grill, skin side up, until browned, about 10 minutes.</li><li>Meanwhile, in pot over medium-high heat, bring reserved marinade to a boil. Lower heat to medium; cook until slightly thickened, 10 minutes. Flip chicken; grill until skin is crispy, 5 minutes. Transfer chicken, skin side up, to roasting pan; roast, basting with marinade occasionally, until cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Arrange chicken on platter; spoon remaining marinade over.</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Grilled Flank Steak with Grilled Scallions</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/Cookout-Menu-Image_Grilled-Flank-Steak-with-Grilled-Scallions.jpg><p>Steak is a hearty addition to your cookout menu, and this recipe infuses flank steak with fresh lime juice and garlic for a zingy and pungent flavor. <strong>Emeril’s pro tip:</strong> Once rested, slice the steak against the grain for perfectly juicy results. “I’d say you have to have a good knife [for slicing any meat against the grain],” he says.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Ingredients:</h3><ul><li>1 ½ pounds flank steak&nbsp;</li><li>¼ cup olive oil</li><li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li><li>¼ cup fresh lime juice&nbsp;</li><li>½ cup chopped cilantro</li><li>1 teaspoon table salt + kosher salt, for seasoning</li><li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li><li>¼ cup chopped scallions + 2 bunches, trimmed</li><li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li><li>Cilantro sprigs and lime wedges</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Directions:</h3><ul><li><strong>Active:</strong> 30 mins</li><li><strong>Total time:</strong> 1 hr, 15 mins + grill prep</li><li><strong>Yield:</strong> 4 servings</li></ul><li>In food-storage bag, mix steak, 3 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, 2 tablespoons lime juice, cilantro, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and chopped scallions.
