Hong Kong’s population today is the product of three massive migratory movements: a large influx of people between 1945 and 1951 as a civil war raged in China; a second influx between 1978 and 1980 at the end of the Cultural Revolution; and a third influx that began in earnest under China’s 150-person-a-day “one-way permit scheme”, which allowed “family reunions” mainly between Hong Kong husbands <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">and mainland wives</span></a>.According to a <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">research paper</span></a> published by the Legislative Council Secretariat in 2020, more than a million mainlanders have arrived in Hong Kong under the scheme from 1997 to 2018, accounting for about 13 per cent of the population then. They were mainly uneducated, poor and living in public rental housing. They accounted for about one third of local marriages, and between 2006 and 2012 mainland women accounted for between 40 and 46 per cent of all children born in Hong Kong.Even in the past three years, it has been <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">migrant flows</span></a> that drive Hong Kong’s demographic challenges. And if it is migrant flows that have been driving Hong Kong’s demographics, then it should be as part of the Greater Bay Area that our demographic challenges should be analysed.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/29/4531601d-9073-4739-8c4c-7ebd39e3770d_c7092b25.jpg>If even a small proportion of the mainland women who have arrived in Hong Kong over the past two decades <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">decide to retire</span></a> back in the Greater Bay Area, then a modest uptick in Hong Kong’s local birth rate will be wholly inconsequential. We might still have a demographic problem, but it is shaped by forces that have nothing to do with delivering a few more local babies.This takes us to the third point – the HK$20,000 handout to new mothers misses the underlying causes of Hong Kong’s low birth rate and will have no impact on incentivising an uptick. In an <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">infographic in the Post</span></a> back in July 2016, Lau Ka-kuen and Dan Bland took three groups – high net worth families, middle-class families and lower-income families – and compared the cost of raising a child to the age of 21.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Raising a child in competitive Hong Kong is just exhausting</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In short, the rich families on average spend about HK$14.2 million getting their child through to university graduation, a middle-class family spends about HK$7 million and a lower-income family spends about HK$2.6 million. Most local couples know the numbers.</p>One-off payments are insufficient. As newly married Michelle Lee said, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">such sweeteners</span></a> “will not help me with a responsibility that I will have for the rest of my life”. <img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/10/25/CLEAN-THUMB_0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:05</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Hong Kong halves buyer’s stamp duty for non-residents as part of measures to boost economy</p><p>Hong Kong halves buyer’s stamp duty for non-residents as part of measures to boost economy</p>Neither will they address the challenge of raising a family in an average-sized 480 sq ft Hong Kong flat. In comparison, the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">average-sized home in Singapore</span></a> is about 800 sq ft, 720 sq ft in Shanghai and 760 sq ft in Shenzhen. If Lee is serious about incentivising bigger families, he will start by making a decent-sized home affordable for the average Hong Kong family.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I offer one final thought on this inept plan. If we take last year’s 32,600 babies as a benchmark, then just keeping the birth rate at the current level is going to cost an annual HK$652 million. If by some miracle this incentive doubled the coming year’s birth rate, producing an additional 32,600 new babies, this would cost HK$1.30 billion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This is in a context where migrant fluxes could reach more than 100,000 a year. If our “result-oriented” chief executive is truly serious about tackling our demographic challenges, he will look at migration flows. His HK$20,000 handout is spitting in the wind, and he knows that as well as I do.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">David Dodwell is CEO of the trade policy and international relations consultancy Strategic Access, focused on developments and challenges facing the Asia-Pacific over the past four decades</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLC5zJ6lrWefpbavtc6nZpqqpJ6wrbGObGlscWVrg3DDx7Jko6eYo3qtscSsZJuZkq56o7vNrqpmnp%2BkubR5xqijnWWYpLuoecqopaA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
