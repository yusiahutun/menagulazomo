Kristin Cavallari was a wild child long before her days on &#34;Laguna Beach.&#34;
On Thursday's new episode of &#34;Very Cavallari,&#34; the reality star and husband Jay Cutler took a trip back to her hometown of Barrington, Illinois, where she revealed just how much of a troublemaker she was in her early teen years.
&#34;I moved out of Barrington to Laguna Beach to live with my dad because I was getting into a lot of trouble and my mom didn't really know what to do with me,&#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"I actually really hated my mom growing up, as most teenagers do," she said.</p><p>As they reminisced, Cavallari revealed she once ditched school and took the train into Chicago, and was "taken home by the police" after another night out. Her mom then recalled a night when Kristin, in the 8th grade at the time, tried to sneak in through the bathroom window after "a few cocktails" and got stuck. "I was so drunk, I couldn't get back into my room," Kristin said, crying from laughter.</p><p>"I started getting into quite a bit of trouble when I was in 8th grade," she explained in a confessional. "I would sneak out a lot. I remember one time I stole my stepbrother's car. I started drinking, smoking pot, having sex. I got arrested a couple times." Again, she couldn't stop cracking up revisiting her past.</p><p>"I can laugh about it now, I was not laughing then," added her mom, before they both started teasing Jay about being a good boy in his youth. "Jay never got in trouble," said Kristin, who revealed he only broke curfew after his high school graduation.</p><p>"We never would have been friends in high school," she added in a confessional. "I wouldn't have looked twice at Jay in high school. He wasn't my type. I was hanging out with the bad boys."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:2198da04-4286-5f22-a3c8-59860e728637 data-container-ref=toofab:article:10170761-bbfc-57b7-9958-b45eefea6f66 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3e/5by4/2020/01/16/3ee87143d40d551b850bb80804d2ff0a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">E!</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Very Cavallari Recap: Kristin's 'Ex BFF' Storms Out When Confronted with Affair Rumors</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>After her mom pulled out some old newspaper and magazine clippings from her "Laguna Beach" days, Cavallari reflected on that time in her life too.</p><p>"My life back then was a little wild and crazy. I don't regret anything. I wouldn't change it for the world, I'm just happy that my life evolved," she said. "I don't miss that old life at all, I'm happy Jay kind of grounded me."</p><p>While she has no regrets, she did have a message to her younger self: "I would tell 22-year-old Kristin to enunciate and quit drinking so much. I was such a f--king sloppy bomb!"</p><p>"Very Cavallari" airs Thursdays on E!</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:df1fe2a2-a831-595f-b132-e06c328f1010 data-container-ref=toofab:article:10170761-bbfc-57b7-9958-b45eefea6f66 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/1f/5by4/2020/01/15/1fb4b491193d5eaaae88e3febd8912f0_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">E!/Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kristin Cavallari Details 'Trust Issues' After Fallout with BFF Over Jay Cutler Rumors</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3F7j2pmbGhfoL%2Bqv9OipWabkauurbjAq6BmmaKnsrTAxJ1kpZmXqruiecGemJygXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
