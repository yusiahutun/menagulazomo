I can't say counting sheep. I count grandkids."</p><p>Jenner went on to express to Katie Couric, who recently became a grandmother, that she has a great deal of things to look forward to and that it's sometimes funny how her relationship with her grandchildren evolves. She said, "I have so many, but I'll go through...they go through this period where they aren't as lovey-dovey, like at about 18 months, as I wish they were. And then all of a sudden, six months later, they won't stop calling your name or being right there hugging you."</p><h2 id=661a93c5533f1><strong>Kris Jenner reveals she never holds back on giving parenting advice</strong></h2><p>During the same interview, the mother of six, Kris Jenner, revealed that she does not hold back when it comes to delivering parenting advice to her children. Jenner said, "I always speak my thoughts... when you want to make a comment or give unwanted counsel. I'm sure I annoy my kids all the time. I'm always giving advice, or we send things to each other.”</p><p>She further added. "I send so many things, like on DM, and I'll send them a reel or a tip I've learned, or I'll say, 'Did you hear about this having too much sugar? You realize you can't eat this poison.’ So I'm sure my kids think I'm crazy, but they're very respectful and probably pretend to like my counsel.”&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Jenner is the mother of six children: <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Kris Jenner Hilariously Pokes Fun At Having Big Family And 13 Grandkids ","1294979","https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/kourtney-kardashian-and-travis-barker-relationship-timeline-exploring-the-couples-romance-over-the-years-1294146","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/kris-jenner-hilariously-pokes-fun-at-having-big-family-and-13-grandkids-1294979","Kourtney Kardashian,","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","hollywood")'>Kourtney Kardashian,</a> <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Kris Jenner Hilariously Pokes Fun At Having Big Family And 13 Grandkids ","1294979","https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/kim-kardashian","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/kris-jenner-hilariously-pokes-fun-at-having-big-family-and-13-grandkids-1294979","Kim Kardashian","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","hollywood")'>Kim Kardashian</a>, <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Kris Jenner Hilariously Pokes Fun At Having Big Family And 13 Grandkids ","1294979","https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/khloe-kardashian-pays-tribute-to-daughter-ahead-of-her-birthday-says-biggest-blessing-was-being-pregnant-alongside-kylie-jenner-1294961","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/kris-jenner-hilariously-pokes-fun-at-having-big-family-and-13-grandkids-1294979","Khloé Kardashian","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","hollywood")'>Khloé Kardashian</a>, <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Kris Jenner Hilariously Pokes Fun At Having Big Family And 13 Grandkids ","1294979","https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/why-are-fans-trolling-kendall-jenners-new-gucci-campaign-netizens-call-it-unreal-1292768","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/kris-jenner-hilariously-pokes-fun-at-having-big-family-and-13-grandkids-1294979","Kendall Jenner","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","hollywood")'>Kendall Jenner</a>, Kylie Jenner, and Rob Kardashian, and the grandmother to thirteen grandchildren.</p><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","Kris Jenner Hilariously Pokes Fun At Having Big Family And 13 Grandkids ",1294979,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/been-quite-the-week-kris-jenner-thanks-fans-for-support-after-sister-karen-houghtons-death-1289751","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/kris-jenner-hilariously-pokes-fun-at-having-big-family-and-13-grandkids-1294979","Content Also read","entertainment","hollywood"),triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Kris Jenner Hilariously Pokes Fun At Having Big Family And 13 Grandkids ",1294979,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/been-quite-the-week-kris-jenner-thanks-fans-for-support-after-sister-karen-houghtons-death-1289751","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/kris-jenner-hilariously-pokes-fun-at-having-big-family-and-13-grandkids-1294979","‘Been Quite The Week’: Kris Jenner Thanks Fans For Support After Sister Karen Houghton’s Death ","Also_Read","entertainment","hollywood")'><strong>‘Been Quite The Week’: Kris Jenner Thanks Fans For Support After Sister Karen Houghton’s Death</strong></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX528rbjYsKaonF%2Bgv6q%2FjKOcp6aVp3qptcuaqaKnpai5unnPqKKeq12bwq95wK1koZmmnruoecGinmaekaK2rcWMmqWdZWFoeqi%2BwKebpKGUqHpyfphtcHBx</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
