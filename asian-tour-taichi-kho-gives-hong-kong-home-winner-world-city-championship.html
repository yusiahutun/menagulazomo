“It was hard for me to keep it [under control] walking up the 18th because I knew what was in front of me. Just being at home in front of everyone, having my parents here, it just means the world to me.”
Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung Yun-hung paid tribute to Kho and said his victory highlighted how Hong Kong’s golf bosses had “nurtured young athletes”."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Kho hooked his approach towards the trees and was fortunate to see it bounce back in the direction of the fairway rather than deeper into trouble.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Facing a fight to save par, his wedge from 60 yards out bounced at the front of the green, took two smaller hops and nestled into the hole for a birdie. That moved the Hongkonger to 12 under and gave him a bit more breathing space.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Up ahead, Australian Smyth was moving up the leader board and four birdies in five holes lifted him to 10 under and alone for a while in second.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kho got back-to-back birdies on 12 and 13, reducing the damage of dropping a shot at 11, to get to 13 under, and while Smyth’s charge faltered over the closing holes and ended at 18 when he went left off the tee, Tabuena’s putter became even colder.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/26/058dabd7-c249-4a32-a4e3-050260516bac_33042db7.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Having lipped out when looking at birdie on the long 13th, the Filipino then left his approach well short on 15, three-putting for bogey. Kho, though, showed his first sign of nerves and missed a simple putt for par himself and dropped back to 12 under.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hendry, meanwhile, rattled in birdies at 16 and 17 to move to within two of the lead, but that was as close as he got. Any suggestion of jitters was gone by the time the group reached the last tee, and Kho’s drive left him little more than 80 yards to the green.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It definitely wasn’t fearless, and I was definitely nervous, which I think was perfectly natural,” Kho said. “But I said to myself ‘I’ll be a better player by the end of it if I stick to my game plan and not shy away from it’.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I said to my coach last night, whether I had a two-stroke lead or was back by one on the last hole, I would take driver, and I feel that’s the reason I succeeded this week.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The crowd, which had grown throughout his round, numbered in the thousands at that point, and the cheer for Kho as he approached the green was the loudest of the week.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With a comfortable cushion, Kho putted out for par and was then immediately surrounded by family and friends.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I just want to thank everyone who came out today to support,” he said. “I really felt a lot of momentum on my side, and they were part of it too.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hendry and Smyth will also play in the Open at Royal Liverpool later this year, but it was a miserable day all around for Tabuena.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His two-over 72 dropped him to eight-under overall and in a tie for fourth with Bio Kim, who shot five-under. Kim took the final Open spot courtesy of his better world ranking.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1moKecm3yivtOimqWdX2h%2FcoCXcW5omaOerq9506isq2WklraktMhmoqGnXZy2t7HSZp%2BoppdiuLC6xmafqKWVYsSqus2eqWavn6e5pXnCoquyZZOdrq68yKilrKCZpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
