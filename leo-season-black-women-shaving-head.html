I was in college, and I never expected that decision to have such a positive impact on my life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While taking the plunge can be scary at first, over the past decade, I've fallen in love with being bald-headed, and appreciate everything the experience has brought me. For starters, I've saved a ton of money by not having to pay for consistent haircuts and salon appointments, which for Black women can be extremely costly. I've also gotten back a lot of time, which has only resulted in being able to do more of the things I love, and increased my productivity. Plus, my confidence and self-esteem have both been boosted since there is nothing to hide behind anymore.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Black women in America, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>our natural hair has been politicized </a>and used as a weapon against us, ultimately keeping us from accessing opportunities and spaces. This has permeated every aspect of our lives, from the workplace, to relationships, dating, and sports.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Black women have had and continue to pay the price — literally by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>spending more than any other race</a> on hair care products to try and conform to unrealistic white European, racist, misogynist standards of what beauty should look like. And as a result, we have grown up dealing with microaggressions because of our hair, and believing that our natural beauty is undesirable and will never be "enough."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy of Author</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The damage of these harmful beautiful ideals has continued to linger in the Black community. And it results in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Black women being far more prone to hair loss</a> due to over manipulation, all because of the effort we put in to avoid having short "nappy-headed" hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">All that said, seeing as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener">Leo season</a> is all about confidence, being bold, and feeling inspired — it's the perfect time for Black women who've been toying with the idea of the big chop to just do it. Give yourself that long-awaited feeling of freedom and empowerment; give yourself an opportunity to rediscover who you really are. Black women owe it to themselves to break free of these toxic beliefs that are holding them back from accepting their true beauty and essence.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I currently shave my head once a week, and the feeling of starting fresh makes me feel so powerful and more in tune with my womanhood than ever before — more so than when I had long hair.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy of Author</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But despite European ideals still being seen as the benchmark, it seems like more Black women are moving away from this and disregarding fragile opinions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We saw Jada Pinkett Smith embrace and come to love her baldness, even after being <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>publicly humiliated at the Oscars</a>.

The chats are always fun and usually end with them telling me that they have always wanted to cut off all their hair, but that they never felt they could.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Well, now is the time to do it!
