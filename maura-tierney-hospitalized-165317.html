Maura Tierney Was Hospitalized After Scary Bike Accident</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-29</div><p>She’s on the mend! The Affair star Maura Tierney was recently hospitalized following a scary bike accident. <a href=# rel=dofollow>TMZ</a> first reported on Monday, Aug. 27 that the star was rushed to the ER after a car struck her back tire while she rode her two-wheeler on the streets of Marina del Rey.&nbsp;</p><p>The news outlet released photos of Maura laying on the ground and then in a wheelchair with a neck brace on after the hit. The ER star reportedly told EMT she was experiencing back pain from the incident. According to TMZ, police believe the driver of the vehicle was not under the influence of drugs and alcohol — it was just simply an accident.&nbsp;</p><p>Later on Monday, <a href=# rel=dofollow>People</a> confirmed Maura left the hospital and is now doing well. “Maura has been released from the hospital with no major injuries,” her rep revealed in a statement. “Thank you to everyone who has reached out with their concern.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/maura-tierney.jpg><p>Maura’s hospital visit comes just a few years after she candidly opened up about her 2009 breast cancer diagnosis. “It was the most surreal, crazy moment. Of course I wouldn’t know that by looking at it!” she told <a href=# rel=dofollow>People</a> in 2012. “I remember thinking, ‘I’m so young. This can’t be happening.'”</p><p>She was 44 at the time and had no family history of the disease. “I wasn’t angry and never said, ‘Why me?’ But I was scared,” she once confessed. “My prognosis is good, but I knock on wood.”</p><p>After a skin-sparing mastectomy and three weeks of chemotherapy, Maura finished treatment in 2010. “It’s not fun, but it’s not as scary as I thought,” she shared. “I was able to continue running, riding my bike and hiking, so it was endurable.” We’re so glad Maura is feeling better today following her cancer battle and bike accident!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mmK6qkWLBqrHRp5yyZZikwLG105qjorKVmXpygpRsaHBn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
