e1346ty31">“Even if the yen appreciates to the level at HK$6, or even HK$7 for 100 Japanese yen, it is still a bargain,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Japanese currency at one stage on Friday fell to 100 yen to HK$4.98.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Huen said tour prices would not be slashed, despite the sinking yen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The air tickets and the hotel fees will also rise rapidly due to keen competition,” he explained. “Not only Hong Kong, people from different parts of the world are also flocking to Japan.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0

holidays had just opened for applications and he was optimistic that more people would sign up.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Simon Wong Kit-lung, founding chairman of the Hong Kong Japanese Food and Cuisine Association, said the price of Japanese food did not necessarily come down because of a fall in the yen as cost depended on the price set by importers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He predicted there would be no impact on the price of Japanese food in Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But retail sector representatives and economists said more attractive prices in Japan could hit stores and the catering trade, although they predicted the impact would not be substantial.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lawmaker Peter Shiu Ka-fai, who represents the retail sector, said Hong Kong’s currency, pegged to the US dollar, had long stood at a high level compared to some neighbouring countries, which made travelling and spending money elsewhere more appealing to city residents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Shiu agreed he did not expect the effects to be substantial as the yen had been weak for a while.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He highlighted Hong Kong’s variety of activities and events, such as fireworks and drone displays, could encourage the public to stay, as well as attract tourists from other places, which would boost spending.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9

Kong Department Stores and Commercial Staff General Union, said a strong Hong Kong dollar and a weak yen would continue to attract residents to Japan for sightseeing and shopping.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He added the government should boost promotion efforts to attract more tourists from newer markets like the Middle East and African countries to lessen any impact.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Professor Terence Chong Tai-leung, the executive director of the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance, also predicted a limited impact from Japan’s sinking yen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The Hong Kong dollar is currently strong, and the number of outbound travellers exceeds that of incoming visitors,” he said. “But the impact will not be huge.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Hong Kong is a large economy, which will not be significantly impacted by a limited number of travellers.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chong said, despite the weak yen, flight tickets to Japan remained expensive and the number of flights to the country remained limited compared to pre-pandemic levels.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He appealed to Hong Kong businesses to adapt to a changing market to ensure survival, including tapping into e-commerce and expanding their operations to travel destinations popular with Hongkongers.</p><p class=postsid
