We know it’s not going to be easy. The Cambodians play good football. They pass the ball well and they have able players. Their [playing] surface obviously plays a role over there. It’s not what our players are used to. Our players are used to playing on more or less on grass. It is an artificial surface [in Cambodia] and from what I’ve heard, it’s pretty hard. We will take that into our minds and will make our preparations to make sure that every player is as comfortable as possible for that. The bottom line is that we want to take a positive result from there,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Paatelainen and his charges will be provided with an acid test when they take on Iran, the highest Fifa ranked Asian team at the moment (Fifa world ranking 23) and the Finn is under no illusions of the task at hand.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s going to be a big test for us. But you know, we have a plan on how we going to play and how we want to make life very difficult for Iran and cause them problems as well. I’m very looking forward to that test.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Of the youngsters, the Hong Kong coach has dropped most of the youngsters who disappointed against Taiwan, leaving out Eastern’s Yue Tze-nam and Shinichi Chan of Kitchee and only retaining Tai Po’s Sun Ming-him.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">HONG KONG WORLD CUP SQUAD</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Goalkeepers:</strong> Yapp Hung-fai (Eastern), Wang Zhenpeng (Kitchee), Yuen Ho-chun (Lee Man)</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Defenders:</strong> Chak Ting-fung, Fung Hing-wa (Eastern), Festus Baise (Guizhou Hengfeng), Andrew James Russell (Hebei China Fortune), Daniel Cancela Rodriguez, Helio Jose De Souza Gonclaves, Tong Kin-man (Kitchee), Tsui Wang-kit (Meizhou Hakka), Leung Nok-hang (R&F).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Midfielders:</strong> Lee Ka-yiu, Xu Deshuai (Eastern), Tan Chun-lok (Guangzhou R&F), Huang Yang, Ju Yingzhi (Kitchee), Philip Chan Siu-kwan (Kwoon Chung Southern), Wong Wai.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Forwards:</strong> Alexander Oluwatayo Akande (Dalian Yifang), Alessandro Ferreira Leonardo (Sandro), Sun Ming-him (Wofoo Tai Po), James Stephen Gee Ha, (Kwoon Chung Southern)</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Paatelainen puts faith in experience</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mn6efqa%2BiuMtomKusmZi5pnuSaWlsaWdufK61165kqZmRqbKtrcinnKdlo6m2pLfSZpyxqJWntqa6wp5koZ1do66usdJmaWxlo6m%2FsLrGZp%2BoppdiuLC6xg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
