He wants to be a tennis player and start a tournament for children at Longleat, so we're resurfacing the tennis court. He wants to play in it, sell the tickets and organise it all.</p><p id=et6Whb5QbcdN data-wc=30>"Both he and Henry have started to learn to fence," she continues. "Henry joins in with everything but isn't as hyper-bothered.

"A few weeks ago, Lord Freddie and Sophie Windsor brought their daughters Maud, who's 10, and Isabella, seven, down to see us, so John and Henry took them on safari.

The mind can&nbsp;make thoughts scatter like jacks, but after a run, they fall into place with clarity for me. I like to take the boys out for runs all over the estate too. I'm trying to instill in them that getting out into the fresh air is very important."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6fa1ec64221d-emma-thynn-1.jpg><h2>Baby number three</h2><p id=ey5mYqb-todG data-wc=28>Previous generations of Marchionesses were expected to continue having children, long after dutifully producing the required 'heir and a spare'. Although times have changed, would Emma like more?</p><p id=eVUychkl4R6o data-wc=26>"Not right now," she says, smiling. "Keeping up with the boys is a lot – they're on different schedules at school already.
