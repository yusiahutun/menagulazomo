But here's another (slightly less stressful!) fact: it's also a wonderful opportunity to upcycle and recycle clothing, as well as wear vintage fashion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To sum things up, retrogrades are moments in which we look back and revisit, revise, and reassess. Additionally, it's a time to interweave the past and present together. Given that Venus, the planet of beauty and clothing, is slowing down this month, what better way to use this vibe to its maximum capacity than by wearing pre-loved pieces? Whether that means shopping for vintage items or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>digging out the stuff in the back of your closet</a>, opting to wear old clothes shows us, in the simplest of ways, that it's wonderful to love and pay homage to the past.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, considering plenty of '80s, '90s, and early '00s styles are currently resurfacing, it's an easy way to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>embrace 2022's top trends</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's also the fact that wearing pre-loved clothing is good for the environment, and if you're <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hoping to shop less in the new year</a>, will perfectly align with those goals. At the same time, the decision will prove to be plentiful for your soul over these 40 days and 40 nights. You'll find some amazing items that have already lasted a lifetime, and might even feel inspired by previous decades' elegance and sophistication.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead, take a look at pre-loved items that are perfect for your zodiac sign.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aries></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aries</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What to Wear or Buy: </strong>A old school rock-inspired tee, such as something from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>the Hard Rock Cafe</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Being a fire sign means that Aries are born to rock and roll, so the perfect pick is a fun vintage tee to match that attitude. Depending on location, they might not be able to visit a Hard Rock Cafe in person, but they can still remember the restaurant and wear its flair with pride on their chests.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-taurus></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Taurus</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What to Wear or Buy: </strong>Vintage earrings.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Tauruses love luxury items, particularly those that have a story to go with them.

Therefore, they will adore a throwback fanny pack that holds all the essentials and lets them move around from appointment to appointment with ease. It'll allow this sign to skip the stress of having to remember to grab all the things (keys, wallet, phone, purse) before heading out the door.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cancer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cancer</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What to Wear or Buy: </strong>A cozy pair of winter boots.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A pair of rain boots will keep Cancer's pinchers (AKA feet) nice and toasty during the upcoming winter months, not to mention protect them from outside elements — which they usually crawl away from due to being born during the onset of summer.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Melodie Jeng/Getty Images</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-leo></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Leo</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What to Wear or Buy: </strong>A glam winter coat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A shaggy, '70s-inspired coat will allow Leos to let their regal 'golden fleece' shine in the coming months.

Considering they prefer to mix and match items, Virgo will totally fall in love with something classic, such as a white lace top, which transcends time and decades. It's possible this piece will even become their new favorite.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-libra></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Libra</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What to Wear or Buy: </strong>Patchwork or embellished jeans.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Instead of your tried and true blues, Libras might enjoy something that tells a story, such as a pair that features patchwork. It will give the air sign something to share every time they pull on these pants, and they'll appreciate the artistry that went into making them.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-scorpio></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Scorpio</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What to Wear or Buy:</strong> An elaborate LBD.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A chic, gothic-inspired dress falls right in line with what Scorpios have always dreamed of and longed for. Complete with a plunging neckline, a tight fit, and a bit of bling, an elaborate design is a definite must-have for the water sign to have in their wardrobe.

A mod option will draw them in and take the archer back in time to the '60s — a period that was full of life and free spirits.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-capricorn></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Capricorn</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What to Wear or Buy:</strong> A shiny or bright pair of pants.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The sea-goat usually opts for clothes that they can wear both in the boardroom and at happy hour, so a colorful, shiny pair of pants are the perfect go-to. Depending on what kind of top they wear, it'll be easy to dress a cool, disco-y bottom up or down for a variety of events and occasions.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aquarius></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aquarius</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_77-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What to Wear or Buy:</strong> A bold, beaded necklace.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_79-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The water bearer is known to have an eclectic and unique fashion sense, which is why they are considered to be trendsetters and style makers.
