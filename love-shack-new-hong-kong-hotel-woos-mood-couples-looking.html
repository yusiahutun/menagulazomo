Then there is the forest-themed room complete with a tent in a mock campsite.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">More unusual rooms have circular beds fitted within giant bird cages or even hanging from the ceiling. Guests are assured they are secure.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In some rooms guests will find chairs of the sort usually seen in gynaecologists’ clinics. Elsewhere, curious contraptions and twisty sofas cater to couples with a penchant for more gymnastic bedroom romps.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Get a room: why a stay at a luxury hotel makes you feel sexy</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yim insists the hotel is a cut above the countless other businesses offering hourly rate rooms in the city, many with fancy to outlandish decor, and usually occupying a few floors or several tiny flats in residential or commercial buildings.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And unlike those establishments that prefer to be coy about their purpose, Yim says Muse X aims to present itself as “a positive and healthy hotel for baau fong”, common Cantonese slang which means going to a love hotel.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are also not like those old villa-style love hotels in Kowloon Tong and two chains which young people consider too old-school,” she said, referring to the Hotel Victoria and Park Excellent Hotel chains.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/10/01/016e30a4-1d29-11ec-897a-4119d31a6faa_1320x770_162708.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Industry veterans believe the 23-storey hotel on Hennessy Road is the first of its kind in Hong Kong, dedicated entirely to couples who lack privacy at home for sex.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If we can build an image that this is not a place just for secret affairs or perversion, but a clean love hotel which serves customers just like a traditional hotel, once the pandemic is gone, we may actually draw different kinds of customers to come for a try,” Yim said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Heading in the same direction, a 15-storey establishment in Mong Kok rebranded itself as the Sober Hotel after converting 20 of its 50 rooms into love nests for short-staying guests.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">General manager Kit Lau said ongoing renovations would turn the premises into a full love hotel in a year’s time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are telling people openly that we’re an hourly hotel. There is nothing embarrassing to hide,” she said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong guest houses transform into love hotels to survive protest slump</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The owner, a low-profile local businessman, tried to advertise his new initiative on television but gave up after failing to secure good time slots. Local television stations might not be ready for their message, Lau added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A themed room in Sober costs HK$270 (US$35) or HK$380 for four hours on weekdays, and HK$30 more on weekends.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Muse X charges HK$280 for two hours or HK$380 for three hours seven days a week.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tourism lawmaker Yiu Si-wing said the two hotels’ new business direction showed the sector adjusting to new realities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/10/01/fe4c3f42-1d28-11ec-897a-4119d31a6faa_1320x770_162708.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said many hotels which previously took in tourists had begun having guests on an hourly basis and were letting out their rooms on monthly terms, neither of which they would have considered before the pandemic.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The whole hotel sector has been pushed to find different sources of guests,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Frequent love hotel user Steven* said themed rooms and special features were attractive, but what mattered more were the price and quality of services such as the helpfulness of staff, user-friendliness of the reservation process and catering.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As for the novelties, people might just give it one try only if the overall quality is not good,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another user, Michelle*, said what mattered most to her was cleanliness in the hotel rooms.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Themed love hotels appealed to couples seeking excitement and new experiences, so the features in the rooms would have to be changed regularly to keep attracting guests, she added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">*Names have been changed at interviewees’ request.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: New ‘positive’ love hotel nothing to be shy about</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZoqqibmZrBunvAq6uim5yafHR9lGlvcXFfoby3sYysn5qbm2K7psOMoaann12gvK%2BzjKGmrZ2cYsSwu9JmpKinlGKwsMHPpZysZZykvKy1zaA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
