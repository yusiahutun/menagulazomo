They have no use for Ken.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ryan then explained that although his kids may have not initially been totally behind the role, they eventually helped him prepare for an especially difficult scene (even if they didn’t realize it). “My kids were around for the months at home, as I was prepping for it, so they, inadvertently, were prepping for it too,” he said. “And they came to set that day and were a huge sense of support and doing it with me off-camera.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This isn’t the first time that Gosling has had to defend his decision to play Ken when making the publicity rounds. Earlier this summer, he addressed criticisms that he was “too old” to play the iconic doll (in the most hilariously candid way) when sitting down for an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>interview and cowboy-themed shoot with GQ</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I would say, you know, if people don’t want to play with my Ken, there are many other Kens to play with,” he told the outlet. “It is funny … this kind of clutching-your-pearls idea of, like, #notmyken. Like you ever thought about Ken before this?... But suddenly, it’s like, ‘No, we’ve cared about Ken this whole time.’ No, you didn’t. You never did. You never cared. Barbie never fucked with Ken.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actor continued, “That’s the point. If you ever really cared about Ken, you would know that nobody cared about Ken. So, your hypocrisy is exposed. This is why his story must be told.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570bKYp2WXpMCttc2gZKShlKh6pLvNn6ysnZRirqO71K1kpJ2eYoR2gpBrbWo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
